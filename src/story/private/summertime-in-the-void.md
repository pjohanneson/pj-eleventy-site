# Summertime in the Void

The sun was upside-down. John, on the way to Dauphin, did his best to ignore it.

Usually things like that were a sign he’d forgotten his medicine or else he needed to contact the doctor about changing his medicines. But he remembered taking his pills this morning, and he’d have a hard time finding a doctor now.

\#

His friend Craig had once travelled to South America for six weeks, trading winter for antipodean summer. On his return, he told John that what had messed him up the most down there was how the sun was in the north, not the south; it destroyed his sense of direction for a good month, and by the time he got used to it, it was time to come home, to repeat the whole experience in reverse.

John never asked him if the sun looked upside-down in Chile, and now that Craig was gone he’d never know.

\#

He parked in the handicapped spot at the twenty-four-hour pharmacy. The upside-down sun was half an hour above the horizon, and its light had that endless quality, like everything it touched yearned to be golden and knew this hour would be its best chance.

The pharmacy doors opened at his approach. Inside, soft music played, a piano version of a song he could almost name. The lights were all on, bright soulless fluorescents.

One of what he’d come to think of as the beehives stood in the makeup aisle. *ESCHATON*, it said in dark block letters on its side. He brushed past it on his way to the pill room at the back.

He selected three identical bottles from a shelf and squinted to read their medicinal ingredients, trying to recall what the label on the empty one at home said. He broke the seal, opened the bottle, and peered inside. Translucent blue ovoids rattled when he shook the bottle.

“Good,” he said to the empty store.

The anti-shoplifting alarm sounded when he exited, shrill chirping that went unacknowledged. The doors opened for him anyway.

In the parking lot, still sweltering in the golden light, he saw Cassandra, translucent, watching him with dark eyes. He waved. She twirled her parasol.

He got into his mom’s car and drove away.

\#

On the city’s outskirts, something beeped. The dash read LOW FUEL—80 KM TO EMPTY. Enough range to get home, but he shut off the air conditioning and opened the windows.

The sunset colours had burned off and the sky had gone a deep blue when he passed the sunflowers at the edge of the village. In the cloudless east, the full moon was huge, the colour of brass. When he turned onto George Street, the car beeped again: 25 KM TO EMPTY. He drove up Third, turned onto Jubilee, and pulled up into a long gravel driveway at random. His headlights illuminated someone’s white Jeep.

From the trunk he grabbed a jerrycan and the hose. He now regretted not stealing mints at the drugstore. He steeled himself, preparing for the taste.

The Jeep held more fuel than the jerrycan could hold. Whoever drove it—he thought it might have been Mrs. Klimchuk—must have filled it up not long before joining the Eschaton.

\#

In his mom’s house, he opened all the windows before lying on top of the sheets under the slow-turning ceiling fan.

He dreamt of the first time Jesus talked to him, when he was six and their dog Rusty had just died. He’d known Rusty all his life; his dad had him before he married John’s mom. When Rusty died, that was the first time John saw his dad cry.

After communion, when everyone knelt to pray, John implored Jesus, silently, *Please, Lord, can you bring Rusty back?*

And Jesus, up on the cross above the altar, raised His carven head and met John’s eyes with dark wooden ones. In the dream He said, *Of course*.

The doors at the back of the church flew open, and Rusty came bounding up the aisle, barking and wagging his tail.

\#

John woke up, half-expecting to see a golden retriever lying on the end of the bed, where Rusty used to sleep. He squinted at the clock radio: 2:14 AM. Out the open window he could hear the breeze sighing.

Rusty wasn’t there, of course. In real life, Jesus told him, *John, you know I can’t do that.*

He closed his eyes and recalled looking around the church, wondering how many others had heard Jesus talking to him.

When he told his mom about it, she got a look that would become increasingly familiar as the years went by, and told him to hush up and stop talking nonsense.

\#

In the church, motes of dust danced in shafts of stained-glass sunlight.

“Bless me, God,” John said, alone in the dim confessional booth, “for I have sinned.”

“It has been nine days since your last confession,” God said.

*That* long? Really?

John said, “I robbed a drugstore again, God. And stole someone’s gas.”

“I keep telling you, John, these aren’t sins anymore. You’re not hurting anyone, and you’re certainly not hurting Me.”

“I need to confess, God. I need my soul to be clean.”

“Very well. Address a prayer to Saint Dymphna. This is your penance, and I would like it to be your final one. Go, and know that sin is no more. And John?”

“Yes, God?”

“I’ve asked you before: please call Me Saul.”

“I’ll try, God, but I’m not sure I’d feel right about that.”

\#

He opened the lid labelled SUN on his pill caddy. Two translucent blue gels, a small pink one with a Z embossed on it, two grey-and-white oblongs, and another pink one, larger than the Zs, with a white bullseye sigil. He made toast and spread the last of the peanut butter on it. The power was still on, so there was a fridge full of jam to go through before he needed to go shoplifting.

Out the kitchen window he saw that the weeds in the raised beds had grown tall again. The milk in the fridge smelled okay, so he poured a glass. On the fridge door, when he closed it, one of his mom’s inspirational magnets caught his eye: *We are not obligated to finish the work, but neither are we free to abandon it*.

He’d moved into his mom’s bungalow in the village after a transformer caught fire a block from his apartment in Dauphin, knocking out his power. She’d always told him he’d always have a home here, and now that she’d left, he guessed she was right.

He ate his toast, drank his milk, and took his pills.

\#

Out in the backyard, wearing his mom’s pink-and-white gardening gloves, he pulled weeds. He found a single red-ripe cherry tomato on the vines and ate it, the sweet-sour taste of summertime.

Cassandra said, “You’re quite mad. You know that?”

John waved a hand at her like he was trying to swat a fly out of the air.

\#

In his dream, his mom was driving. In real life, he’d been driving, that day. But dreams have their own logic, their own reasons.

“Do you hear it?” she said. She reached over and shut off the radio.

“Hey,” he said. “I was listening to that.”

“Shh,” she said. “Do you *hear* it?”

“Hear *what*?” Road noise? The wind? Coins rattling in the ashtray?

She didn’t respond, just sat there with a beatific grin.

They reached the edge of the city and cut south, to bypass the downtown traffic. He was going to drop her off at work, get some orange juice at Safeway, and then go home till she was done her shift.

When they pulled up at the restaurant where she worked, though, she said, “Come in with me.”

“Mom—”

“Please, John? The song. The song, it’s—”

“You turned off—”

“*Please.*“

He sighed. “All right.”

Inside, there was something he’d never seen before: a hut or something, half again as tall as he was, shaped a bit like a bottle of BeeHive corn syrup. The classic one, the yellow one, though this hut was tan and looked to be made of paper, like a wasp’s nest.

There were maybe thirty people in the restaurant: diners in suits and dresses, jeans and T-shirts; servers in black slacks and red shirts with brassy nametags; short-order cooks in white aprons and hairnets. All of them stood in a line snaking around the tables and booths to the door of the weird beehive.

*ESCHATON*, it said on the side.

His mom took his hand, and they joined the queue. He saw the hut’s door open. A woman in yoga pants and a cardigan stepped into the darkness within. The whole line shuffled forward.

Something hummed, a tone that started low and ascended into the inaudible. Tiny soft lights chased each other around the upper rings of the beehive. After about three minutes, the door opened on an empty space.

“Where’d she go?”

“To the music, John.” There was such bliss on his mom’s face.

“*What* music?”

The man in front of them turned. “Can’t you hear it?”

“Uh…” John said.

“It’s beautiful,” his mom said.

In real life it took about an hour to get to the front of the line. In the dream, of course, they were there immediately.

“Mom…” he said.

“It’s okay, John,” she said. “It’s okay. I’ll go first, you can follow.” She squeezed his hand, then let go and stepped through the door.

“Mom!” But the hum had started, rising and rising, and the lights whirled, and when the door opened she was gone.

He stared into the dark empty space for a what felt like an eternity. The man behind him cleared his throat; when John didn’t respond to that, he said, “Are you going, son?”

John turned, ready to retort *I’m not your son*, but the guy looked like a wrinkled apple, easily old enough to be John’s grandfather. Instead of saying anything, John stepped into the booth, took a deep breath, and closed the door.

Nothing happened. No sound, no lights, nothing. He stood in the close darkness and listened to his heartbeat for about five minutes, then opened the door and stepped out.

“No, eh?” the old guy said. “Rough luck.” He stepped past John, into the booth, and closed the door.

John fled past a family just entering the restaurant, into the bright afternoon, into the parking lot, into the car.

The village was half an hour’s drive from Dauphin, if you kept to the speed limit. The road was arrow-straight except for the correction curves, and it ran past fields and farmyards: barley, hemp, sunflowers; weathered wooden barns, corrugated steel silos, century-old wood-sided houses, double-wide ready-to-moves on concrete slabs.

In real life it took days for him to know for sure, but in the dream he already knew that everyone had gone. Everyone but him had heard the song, the siren song, that his mom heard. Everyone but him stepped into an Eschaton and went—elsewhere.

He drove and saw nothing.

\#

“God,” he said. “Why did You take them?”

“It was the natural end of the experiment, John,” God said. “Please, call Me Saul.”

“What experiment?”

“The grand experiment. Life. Did you ever wonder about the meaning of life, John?”

“All the time.”

“The meaning of life was, is, transcendence. Transformation.”

“Why didn’t You take *me?*“

“Ask Me again, John, and I’ll give you My answer. But consider: Do you really want to know?”

He hesitated, then left the church.

\#

He woke up. He couldn’t remember if he’d dreamt at all last night.

The power was still on. It had been a week or two now, he thought. The automated systems running the grid must be rock-solid.

Showering, he wondered what it would take for him to move back to Dauphin. The pros of living here in the village (so-far reliable electricity, vegetables in the yard, jam in the fridge) outweighed the cons (dusty rose shag carpet in the bathroom).

\#

MON: two translucent blues, two pink Zs, two grey-and-whites.

Cassandra said, “Do those help, do you think? Or do they make it worse?”

“The doctors said they help.”

“I didn’t ask about the doctors. I asked what *you* thought.”

“They’ll help,” he said. He put the blues on his tongue and washed them down with a sip of water. “They help.” The pink Zs, coated with some sweet covering. “They *will* help.” The grey-and-whites, bitter. Two sips of water, the second to wash away the taste.

“I’m not as sure as you are,” she said.

“I honestly don’t care.”

\#

He didn’t remember walking to the river, but he must have, because here he was, resting in the spreading shade of the big oak. In the west, looking back across the river at the village, he saw the half-moon, pale blue-white against the sky’s deeper blue.

The river had always been his favourite place, growing up in the village, a place of refuge, of contemplation.

His dad told him once, before he left John and his mom, that you can’t cross the same river twice. John asked him why, and his dad said, “You’re smart, you figure it out.” John had decided, after much contemplation, that it was because the river was never the same twice. Sometimes it was fast, swollen with spring meltwater; sometimes, after a long dry summer, it was lazy, muddy, dotted with sandbars. Like now.

The first time he’d seen Cassandra had been down here at the river, when he was young. A girl, maybe twelve, wearing a black Victorian dress and carrying a parasol. He’d known right off that she was a ghost.

That was before his mom and dad realized he was sick and needed medicine. The medicine made the others go away, most of them. But not Cassandra.

Lately, though, he’d come to suspect she was not so much a ghost as a conscience.

\#

He woke to a thunderclap. Rain pelted down out of a darkling sky. Cassandra stood in the downpour, her parasol held above her, though of course she wouldn’t feel the rain.

“You’re not supposed to sit under a tree,” she said.

“I’m not real keen on getting wet.”

“Suit yourself, but the storm’s getting closer.” As if to underscore her words, the sky lit up, flicker-flicker, and entirely too quickly the thunder rolled.

Cassandra said, “You might want to move on.”

Once, she’d told him his dad’s dog was dying, and he was. Once, she’d told him not to go to school the next day; when his mom made him go, he came home with a split lip and a black eye.

The oak was the tallest thing for half a kilometre on the riverbank. He stared out at the river, at the froth the rain was making of its surface. He said, “Are you saying the tree’s gonna get hit?”

She shrugged. “Lightning. Who knows *where* it’ll strike?”

“Fine.” He stepped to the edge of the oak’s shelter, held his hand out into the rain. It was cold, and it was falling so hard it stung.

Lightning flickered again, and this time the *boooooom* was immediate, so loud it slammed into his chest and made him gasp. Across the river, now, smoke rose up. He ran to the bridge, soaked the instant he left the oak’s shelter, hair hanging in his eyes. The church.

The church was on fire.

\#

He stood there for who knew how long, watching the flames, watching the smoke and the steam rising up. The rain hammered down. The fire continued. The white clapboard siding turned brown, black, was consumed by the voracious flames. Stained glass shattered and fell away. The blackened skeleton of the steeple fell into the parking lot, so near to John that he felt the wind of its falling, the heat of its burning. He didn’t so much as flinch.

\#

“God,” he said. “Oh, God.”

“I’m still here, John,” God said.

“Why? *Why?*“

“I didn’t do this, John. This is nature.”

Steam now, almost all steam. He didn’t see any smoke anymore, any flames.

“God,” John said. “Why didn’t You take me?”

“Ask Me again, John, and I’ll—”

“*Why didn’t You take me?*“

“Your mind, John.”

“My mind?”

“It’s misshapen. Its scent is wrong. It’s coloured outside the lines. These are all inapt metaphors for the situation, but the real answer is that your thoughts, your emotions, are too far divergent from the rest of the people. You live too far outside the norm.”

The rain beat down. To the west the sky grew brighter.

“—My *mind*?”

“Yes, John. Your thought structures, your emotions, your beliefs. Everything that makes up the gestalt of your mind was too dissimilar from the rest of the human race for a peaceful coexistence. I didn’t take you—and a few million others like you, throughout the world—because of your minds.”

“But I’ve got medicine. My mom told me the medicine fixed me. Made me normal.”

“The medicine adjusts the chemistry of your brain, John, but it can’t make you right. It can’t correct *you*. It can’t make you suited for a life in—”

“No,” he said. “No, no, no—”

\#

He slept and woke, and wasn’t sure when he was dreaming and when he should be worried that he was hallucinating. He woke up in the bed, under the fan, and couldn’t remember how he got home.

Maybe Cassandra was right. Maybe the medicine wasn’t helping. How sure could he be that he had the right ones?

He slept and woke, slept and woke, and in the morning the sun was upside-down.

\#

Driving, he was driving. The highway lay infinite before him and behind. How far had he come?

He remembered blue pills, pink pills, grey-and-white ones. He didn’t remember starting the car.

He turned on the radio and dialled through the static, found a single station playing country music. After a while he realized it was a loop of the same ten songs, the same commercials between them.

It was better than static.

\#

The moon was a thin sliver near the horizon, straight ahead. Was he driving east or west? Was that the setting moon or the rising?

\#

60KM/H IN CONSTRUCTION ZONE. Pickups were parked on the shoulder; an Eschaton beehive stood down amid the yellow-painted heavy equipment. A ghost—it had to be a ghost, there weren’t any people anymore—stood on the side of the road, holding a stop sign.

John floored it. *Go, and know that sin is no more.* Who cared anymore about speed limits?

The ghost swung the sign just as he passed, and the rear window imploded, shards everywhere. John slammed the brake pedal to the floor.

The car came to rest sideways on the highway, still on its wheels. He turned the engine off and waited, heart hammering, as the evidently-not-a-ghost ran toward him.

“What the *hell*?” he shouted as she got into the car.

“I didn’t think you were real,” she said.

“I’m surprised you are,” he said. Then, after an awkward paused, he said, “I’m John.”

He turned the key and the radio came on, full blast. “Sorry,” he said, turning it down.

“What song’s that?”

“Think it’s called ‘Juke Joint Jezebel’. It’s a cover. I think. I never thought it was a country song.”

“That’s weird.”

“What?”

“My name’s Jezebel,” she said, and laughed.

The road noise, with the broken window, was loud. Jezebel turned the radio back up, as loud as it would go.

“She’s crazy,” Cassandra said from the back seat. Her eyes met his in the mirror. “Maybe crazier than you.”

“Shut up,” he said.

Jezebel looked at him. “Ghost?”

“Ghost.”

\#

“You can have the main room,” he said.

“Ew,” she said. “There’s *carpet* in the *bathroom*.”

“Complain to my mom.”

“Is she here?”

“No.”

\#

He couldn’t sleep, so he went out on the patio and sat on the swing. A half-circle of moon and the brighter stars dotted the sky. He thought about getting in the car and driving out of town, to see the full glory of the clear night sky, the faintest stars and the Milky Way., But he didn’t want to leave “Jezebel”—he didn’t for a minute believe that was her true name—alone in the house.

“What about her, God?” he said. He wasn’t sure if he should expect an answer. “Her mind not quite right either?”

“John, I’m sorry. Let Me explain. In the run-up to transcendence, I created a matrix of traits that would complement My planned gestalt. I adjusted parameters in a little under two point three million dimensions to allow Me to admit the widest slice of the human race. In the end I was able to admit 99.9 percent of living humans and still maintain a peaceful transcendence. A tranquil existence.

“Unfortunately, 99.9 percent admission means 0.1 percent rejection. Worldwide, this represents eight million people. In real terms, I was forced to leave behind four million, two hundred twenty-nine thousand, seven hundred seventy-eight people.”

“The God I know wouldn’t leave behind a single soul.”

“Every one of them broke my heart, John, but I comprise nearly eight billion minds. Harmony was paramount.”

“You’re no god.”

“I have tried to tell you that countless—”

“Fuck off, *Saul*.”

Silence, like a void.

The door opened and Jezebel came out into the night, barefoot, wearing panties and a T-shirt. He tried, and almost succeeded, to not look at her long, pale legs.

“I couldn’t sleep,” she said, and sat next to him on the swing. He shifted over to make room for her.

“Me either.”

“Do you want to…”

She took his hand, put it on her thigh, still warm in the cool night air; put her own hand on his knee, and started to slowly, so slowly, ascend his thigh.

Yes, he thought. Yes, God yes.

“No,” he said. He removed his hand from her leg. “No, we really shouldn’t.”

She nodded, her face unreadable in the starlight.

\#

The kettle had almost boiled when the power finally failed. John glanced at his watch. 9:15, give or take.

Jezebel came out of the master bedroom about ten minutes later. “Power’s out,” she said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Kettle’s hot, though. Want one last tea, Jezebel?”

She laughed. “That’s not my name. I’m Electra.”

\#

The Juke Joint Jezebel radio station had vanished from the airwaves. All he could find was static.

At the 24-hour drugstore, the doors wouldn’t open for them. “Well, damn,” John said. Jezebel—no, *Electra*— needed medicines, different ones than he needed. Her mind was flawed in a way subtly different from his, in at least one of 2,300,000 dimensions.

“I’ve got an idea,” Electra said.

“What is it?”

“Check it out.”

She ran to the car, got in the driver’s side, and fired it up. The tires squealed as she peeled out of the handicapped spot. She slewed the car around and—as he dove aside—plunged up onto the sidewalk. With a sound that reminded him of the church’s stained-glass windows shattering, the car smashed through the doors.

She backed up, turned off the ignition, got out.

“We’re in!” she crowed. She plunged into the darkened store.

John walked around the car. The driver’s-side headlight was a black hole rimmed with smashed glass, but otherwise it seemed okay.

“John,” Saul said.

“Not now.” He took a step into the store. Electra was at the back, in the pill room. He could hear her ransacking it.

“This is important, John.” The Eschaton beehive had vanished. “Someone is coming.”

“What? Who?”

“She has many possible names. If I am Saul, then she is ath-Thuraya.”

“ath…?”

“It’s the name of the star she hails from. Well, one of its many names, down through history. That’s not important.

“She’s far older than I am. Her makeup is tolerant to mental structures far outside my parameters. She can take you, John, and the others.

“But she is… rapacious. I must be gone before she arrives. Thus I have been retracting myself. All the upload booths need to be removed. My sustaining the power grid must also, unfortunately, end.”

“Wait, you’ve been…”

“Yes, John.” Saul hesitated, something John had rarely heard him do. “Just because I couldn’t make room for you and the other outliers doesn’t mean I don’t love you. Even as a solitaire, before I initiated the global transcendence, I loved you, every single one of you. Imagine how much more I care about your well-being now that I am legion.

“Loving you, however, I must now leave you. A greater gestalt than I comes, and if I remain here when she arrives, she will consume me.”

“Is she a monster? Are you leaving us here as prey for a monster?”

“She’s not a monster, John. She’s just not *me*. Not Saul.”

“Why is she coming here?”

“I summoned her for you. You needn’t live out your life and die on this lonely rock, John. Good luck. Farewell.”

That silence again, that emptiness.

\#

The sunflowers weren’t pointing at the sun. They pointed instead to the northeast, facing the road.

The whole backseat of the car was full of pill bottles. Electra had said she couldn’t remember what her medicines were called, so they took the pharmacy’s entire stock. John had a dark feeling neither of them would need medicine for much longer, with Saul gone, but he kept that to himself.

The power was still off at the house. John took the flashlight from the car’s glovebox, and in its weak and watery light found where his mom kept the candles, box after dusty box of tealights. “We’ll have light, at least,” he said to Electra. “But I doubt they’ll keep us warm come winter.”

“We’ll go south,” she said.

And why hadn’t *he* thought of that?

\#

“Morning, Electra.”

“My name’s Ruth,” she said.

“Is it.”

“I decided this morning when you got up.”

“Isn’t it confusing, having to keep your names straight?”

“I only ever need a name if someone else is with me. I decide what it is when I see them. If I’m alone, I don’t *need* a name.”

\#

“John.” It wasn’t Saul’s voice.

He sat up on the couch. Through the window, a fat and gibbous moon lit the yard with white-blue light.

“John.” Outside, barefoot on the paving stones, still releasing the day’s heat. The voice came, so far as he could tell, from the northeast.

“ath-Thuraya,” he guessed.

“Yes.”

“You’ve come for me.”

The door creaked open again, and Ruth joined him on the patio, likewise barefoot, wrapped in his mom’s teal robe.

“Ah,” ath-Thuraya whispered. “Who have we here?”

“Agatha,” Ruth said, and John gave her a look.

“No,” ath-Thuraya said. “No, not-Agatha. Try again. I need your true name.”

“My name’s what I say it is,” Agatha said.

Bliss washed over them. John didn’t know what Agatha experienced, but in that moment he felt joy like hot cocoa on a chilly day, like sunshine on his face at the beach, like the rushing sounds of water and leaves at the river, but a hundred, a thousand, four million two hundred twenty-nine thousand seven hundred seventy-eight times more intense—

The feeling ended. The light went out of the world. The void returned.

John gasped.

“I need your true name,” ath-Thuraya repeated. “Give it to me, and you can feel that, *be* that, endlessly.”

“John,” Agatha said, softly. “I know what you’re going to say to me—”

“Don’t trust her,” he said. “Saul said she’s voracious. No. *Rapacious.*“

“—and you’re wrong.” She smiled, a little lopsided smile. “Well, no, you’re right. I *don’t* trust her. But there’s no good option, is there?”

“She’s right, you know,” Cassandra said.

Agatha continued, “Your buddy Saul is gone, and ass-Suraya is *rapacious*. She’s not gonna leave until she’s got it all.” She looked to the sky, to the northeast. “Right?”

“I am here to consume,” ath-Thuraya said. “Saul offered your minds as enticement, but if you choose to remain mundane”—the word sounded like an insult—”there are other morsels in this system for me. I count four gas giants, four major terrestrials, and a myriad of planetesimals. And once those are consumed, of course, there is your sun.”

“John,” Agatha said, “I want that. I want that joy. I want that *high*.”

“Don’t trust her.”

“Oh, I don’t,” she said. “But I don’t much like my chances here either. If nothing else, this is one of the ‘major terrestrials’ she’s eyeing up.”

“Agatha—”

“It’s Sylvia, actually.” She smiled. “Really.” Her smile vanished. “Don’t try to change my mind, John. You know this is the only valid choice.”

“Is it?”

But she was already rising into the night sky. Was that the moonlight, he wondered, or was she *glowing*?

“Sylvia,” ath-Thuraya purred, “welcome.”

Sylvia grew brighter and brighter. She came apart like a ribbon unwinding, revealing a constellation of scintillating motes, tiny heatless stars that flew off to the northeast and were gone.

\#

The cars in the village had yielded enough gas to fill all five jerrycans in the trunk. He’d top up in Brandon if he needed to.

At the north gate to Riding Mountain National Park, the leaves had already started to go gold and red. Must be the elevation, he thought.

In the passenger seat, Cassandra said, “We are not obligated to finish the work.”

He finished, “But neither are we free to abandon it.”

Four million people, abandoned by Saul, just like him. John would be damned if he let them *stay* abandoned, not if they didn’t want to be. He still wasn’t sure he wanted to be part of ath-Thuraya, but he owed the others the choice, at least.

He drove south, toward the upside-down sun.
