# The Atlas

There was a country named Untille in Jennifer’s atlas. She showed it to me one drunken night. I sat closer to her on the couch than was proper, considering I had a girlfriend and she did too.

Jennifer said her great-to-the-*n*th-grandmother came from Untille. The country, erased in some primeval war, existed now only in folklore. On the atlas page it bordered Iraq, Uqbar, Syria.

She said, “Want to visit it?”

“Wait, I thought you said—”

“I know what I said.” She went to the kitchen, returned with a green bottle and a hunting knife. The bottle said *ABSENTE* in ye-olde typeface. She offered it to me and I took a swig. It tasted like fennel.

Dizzy, I watched Jennifer drink.

The atlas was on the table, open to Untille. With the knife, she sliced into the page, and I

 smelled

 dirt.

Flowers and grasses, sand and water. Impossible sunlight shone from the slit.

“Want to visit it?” she said again.

It had to be the drink. O please God—

She stepped into the book and was gone. Her voice came to me, as from a great distance: “You coming?”

I fled.

She never mentioned Untille to me again.

This morning, out of the blue, her girfriend Andrea called me. “I haven’t seen Jen in like three days,” she said. “I’m going to her place to make sure she’s okay. Will you come with me?” She knew we were friends.

“Of course,” I said.

While she searched the bedroom, the bathroom, the office, increasingly frantic, I found the atlas. Untille’s page had been excised, sliced as if by a sharp knife.

Could she do that, I wondered, from within the page?

I smelled the faintest whiff of earth and fennel as I closed the atlas and put it back on the shelf.

“*Jennifer?*” Andrea sobbed from the bedroom.
