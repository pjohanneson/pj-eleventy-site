# Make a Wish

In the darkness, all they could hear was the hiss of the river and the chirp of crickets. Oh, and the camera.

Alice and Sam lay side by side on the unzipped, unfurled sleeping bag, hands interlaced, staring up at a north sky half-covered in a rippling sheet of pale green.

The aurora stretched across half the sky, brighter than Alice said she’d ever seen it. Meteors burned fine scratches, radiating from Perseus. The moon hadn’t yet risen, and the Milky Way glowed like a diffuse river.

All told, it looked like the sky was on fire. It looked like the end of the world.

Alice said, “So many falling stars. Make a wish.”

Sam snorted. “What am I, eight?” Thinking: *This was a bad idea.*

On its tripod, Alice’s camera *clack*ed as its shutter closed, then *click*ed as it opened again. She’d set it for ten-second exposures. A shutter-release switch dangled by its cord from the side of the camera, locked in the *on* position. The camera would take photos till Alice unlocked the switch, or its memory card filled up, or the battery died.

Alice turned her head and narrowed her eyes at Sam. “You really have no romance in your soul.”

*clack, click*

“That’s a bit harsh, don’t you think?” Sam kept a light tone, but in truth, it stung a bit. “Just because I don’t believe in ‘wish I may, wish I might’, that doesn’t make me a… a heartless monster.”

“You sure?”

Her tone was gently teasing, so Sam didn’t say the first, inappropriately angry response that came to mind. Looking back at the sky: “Well, what did *you* wish for?”

*clack, click*

Alice laughed, light and flirty. “Don’t be ridiculous. We can’t *tell* each other our wishes. They won’t come true.”

*Odds are pretty good they won’t come true anyway.* Sam didn’t say it aloud. It wasn’t worth a fight.

The river ran east to west. They’d parked in the valley, and steep hills rounded by time rose up to the north and the south. Above the north hill, above the trees, the aurora danced, green laced with shafts of purple and yellow and even—sometimes, fleetingly—red.

*clack, click*

Alice smelled lovely: raspberry-tinged deodorant, vanilla perfume, the last floral vestiges of her shampoo. This sleeping bag, under the stars, it was a good place to be. It wasn’t where Sam belonged.

They’d met a few weeks ago when Sam’s roommate set them up on a blind date. They went to Taco Bell, of all places, a middle ground roughly equidistant from their respective apartments. Alice gushed about astronomy. Over their chalupas, Sam made a lame joke about being an Aries, and Alice’s eyes blazed. “If this is going to go any further,” she said, “you have to promise: *Never* confuse astronomy with astrology.”

Sam was sure it was over, right there, before anything had a chance to get started. But then Alice smiled and said, “You’re cute when you’re nervous, has anyone told you that?”

She showed Sam her photos: long concentric white arcs against a black backdrop, the trails of stars painting the sky as the Earth rotated; the Milky Way rising out of a calm midnight lake, which diffusely reflected its brightness but not its structure; a comet’s long, pale tail pointing away from the just-about-to-rise sun. Sam, impressed, swiped through them, one after another, on Alice’s phone.

In the parking lot they exchanged numbers and a chaste good-night hug. The stars were washed out by the sodium-vapor lamps above them.

More dates followed: good dinner and a bad movie; binging half of a Netflix documentary on a serial killer over a big green bowl of microwave popcorn; strolling in the park where they first held hands, birdsong surrounding them, the trees arching over them like the ribs of some organic cathedral.

Tonight, just after midnight, Alice texted: `omg northern lights. and perseids! u still up?`

Sam hesitated, then replied: `yep.` Knowing it was a bad idea. They wanted different things. Alice was looking for a *relationship*, and Sam… wasn’t. `meet you downstairs?`

`k`, Alice replied.

Bad idea or not, they were soon in Alice’s car, speeding down the highway. “There’s a place I go,” Alice said, her face pallid as a zombie’s in the green dashboard glow. “Out in the valley. It’s nice and dark.”

“Secluded?” Sam said.

“Secluded.”

The green curtain of light rippled like a curtain twitched by the hand of God himself. Alice said, sounding like she was half talking to herself, “It’s lovely.”

“It really is.” Two meteors burned briefly across the sky, headed northeast to southwest.

“I’m glad you were still up.”

“Me too.”

*clack, click*

Maybe it was just Sam’s eyes, adjusting to the darkness, but the aurora seemed like they’d be nearly bright enough to read by.

Another meteor sketched a bright line, the brightest so far, and flashed like lightning as it died. Sam half expected to hear a rumble of thunder afterward, but none came.

*clack, click*

*Maybe I* should *make a wish. You never know. It might come true.*

…Wait. Where did *that* come from?

“Did you…” Sam took a breath and tried not to look at Alice. “Did you just wish that I’d believe in wishing?”

Alice said, “If I tell you, it won’t come true.”

*clack, click*

“That’s such a— Look.” Sam sat partway up, pulled away—with some regret—from Alice’s warmth, her sweet bouquet. “This is a lovely night, and you’re great, really, but…”

“Are you—” Alice sat all the way up. “Are you *breaking up* with me?”

“Alice—”

She held up a hand. “Don’t bother. I know what you’re going to say.” Bitter sarcasm dripped from her voice. “‘It’s not working out.’ ‘It’s not you, it’s me.’ ‘I’m not in the right headspace for a relationship.’ Stop me when I get close.” She turned away from Sam, looked up at the shivering aurora. She wiped angrily at her eyes and said, “God, I’m such an *idiot*.”

“Alice,” Sam said. “Alice, listen.”

“No,” she said, standing up. “I don’t think so.”

Sam, too, stood up, stared up at the rippling aurora. *Damn it, I didn’t want to do this. Not here, not now. What is* wrong *with me? Maybe I’m better off alone.*

Another big meteor flickered across the sky, bright and long, leaving an afterimage in Sam’s vision.

*I wish I was alone.*

*clack*

After a long moment Sam looked down.

Alice was gone. Her car, her camera, her tripod, all gone. Gone like they’d never been.

Sam stood alone under the aurora and the galaxy and the Perseids.

“What… the…”

Sam’s phone buzzed: a text from Alice.

`hey just had a weird dream. did u break up w me? </3 it was so real :(`

Another buzz.

`sry if i woke u up`

And then, at the worst possible moment, the phone flashed its dead-battery icon and went dark.

“*Shit!*“

The flickering green sky above, the quiet dreaming Earth underfoot. No one else was here. Maybe no one else had *ever* been here.

Pocketing the phone, Sam started to climb the hill. Maybe there’d be a car. Sure, hitchhiking sounded like a *great* idea. Getting into a stranger’s car at two AM would definitely be a safe, smart thing to do.

By the time Sam got to the top of the hill, a thin sliver of moon had appeared in the east, above the just-visible glow of the city. How long had Alice driven to get them here? Twenty minutes? Thirty?

Sam sighed, and kept walking.
