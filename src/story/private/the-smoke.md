# The Smoke

The Smoke

by Patrick Johanneson

The first time I saw it, it looked like a needle, the kind you might use to lance a boil, or inoculate an infant, or poison a king.

I find it hard to believe it was nine years ago that I first saw *Tern*, the vessel that would destroy us all. Nine years ago I was still in pre-collegiate, and *Tern* was a long way from me in space as well as time, having only recently breached Gulur’s magnetosphere.

System Defense scanners detected its braking field, invisible to the naked eye but bright and sudden as a supernova in the radio bands. Automated robot probes leapt out to intercept. They transmitted back the first images: a dull grey needle, kilometers long, tapered at either end.

Contact was made on an archaic frequency; the newcomer spoke what was eventually determined to be a drifted version of Russlisch, a language whose lexicon and syntax were buried in a backup archive older than human settlement on Eyja. The ship called itself *Tern*, which a historian discovered was a reference to a migratory bird from Earth.

System Defense ordered *Tern* to go into a parking orbit about Falið, a cold and unpeopled world circling Auga, Gulur’s small and distant companion star.

\#

*Q: You’ve given your name as Hrafn thrall Sylviasdótr erst Vittorisson.*

A: Yes.

*Q. Yet you command a spaceship. Surely you’re no thrall.*

A: I started out a thrall. I’m sure if you check the documentation, my status is given there.

*Q: Hmm. \[Pauses.\] I can’t help but notice you have what is traditionally a woman’s surname, Mr. Sylviasdótr.*

A. My father disagreed with my wishes to participate in the expedition to *Tern*. He forbade me from joining as a jarl’s son, and he ensured that the normal routes any carl might take were closed to me. My father has significant influence in the Eyjaþing, and the Eyjaþing was coordinating the mission via System Defense.

I found a solution, though—I sold myself into thralldom.

*Q: This feels like a digression. I don’t see what this has to do with your name.*

A: Well, my father was furious when he found out I’d sold myself into servitude. “Until you recant,” he said, “I disown thee, I disown thee, I disown thee.”

He made sure to do it in the square, on a working-day, which would ensure the presence of at least the requisite nine witnesses. He thought it would make me recant.

Instead I took my mother’s surname—my birth-mother, not my father’s current wife—and removed his patronym.

\#

*Owl*‘s voyage from Eyja to Falið was a lonely week. The rest of the thralls were kind enough, but they weren’t sociable to me. They didn’t ostracize me, of course, but there was a consistent frostiness to our every encounter, whether in the longroom where we bunked, the dining space, or anywhere else in thrallheim. I had hoped my new name would deflect them from knowing who my father was, but word evidently had got out and they either resented my high birth or they feared incurring the wrath of a highly-placed jarl, even one who’d disowned his son.

The carls kept to their own spaces, only rarely intersecting with the thralls, and the few jarls might as well have been angels: never seen, their presence evident only in the occasional order carried down to the thralls via the carls.

And of course the ship’s-queen was like a god to us, remote in her heaven, her voice sometimes issuing from speakers when she deemed a message important enough to send it out on the all-call.

\#

Over the last nine years, *Tern* has been asked over and over again, subtly at first and then more directly, how many people were aboard. So far it has declined to answer.

*Owl* sat at station-keeping for two ship’s days, in the same orbit as *Tern* but a hundred and eighty degrees separate, so that at all times the mass of Falið separated us. We sent swarms of robots to catalog every pit and pock on the other ship’s surface, to make inquiries, to attempt to teach it Eyjan, to negotiate docking protocols.

In that time we saw seven sunrise and sunsets, because Falið rotates so rapidly.

On the “morning” of the third day, the ship’s-queen made the determination that it was time for a boarding party. *Tern* accepted the suggestion, its voice emotionless.

The jarls selected one of their own, a brute named Églisson, and a ten of carls. Of the thralls they took sixteen, of a group of forty or so; they didn’t know any of us, so they made a subroutine select the best of us. The subroutine knew us only slightly better than the jarls, and so made it a lottery.

I won a place, and thus I met the ghost.

\#

*Q: You called your ship* Owl. *What might be the significance of that?*

A: I didn’t name it, of course. I was just a thrall.

*Q: It’s your ship now. Did you consider renaming it?*

A: I suppose it *is* mine, isn’t it? No, I like the name *Owl*. It seems fitting to me. Do you know what an owl is?

*Q: I’ve been to a zoo.*

A: I’ll take that as a “yes”. We—they—named *Owl* *Owl* because it was a vast-eyed observer flying in the darkness. \[Smiles.\] Did you realize that the Eyjan owl is named after an Earth bird, as well? One that flies by night and has large eyes.

*Q: How interesting. I’ve learned something new today.*

A: That is, however, where the similarities end. For example, the Earth owl has only two wings.

\#

Ship’s time was not tied to the local dawns and crepuscules, because *Owl*‘s clock was set by Eyja’s hours and the world we now orbited spun much, much faster. So the “morning” after the lottery, as we thralls loaded equipment and rations into the space that would become our shuttlecraft, was in truth local midnight, the stars ablaze on the screens that showed the outside view.

I paused after setting a case of coffee on the decking to stare, rapt, at the Milky Way, brighter and more colorful than I’d ever seen it. One of the overseeing carls, noticing me stopped, pointedly cleared his throat. I shook myself out of it, turned, bowed my head just a shade deeper than was appropriate, and went back into the corridor for the next case, and the next after that.

Hours later, the shuttle budded off from *Owl*‘s body. Technically it had a hexadecimal designation, one that the computers on *Owl* would use to communicate with its subordinate subroutines, but one of the carls suggested we call it *Owlet* for the duration of its existence, and Jarl Églisson judged it a suitable eke-name.

We entered a lower orbit, which made us faster , allowing us to close the gap between *Owl* and *Tern*. It still took long slow hours—almost a day—not fast, the way they show it in the entertainments.

The screens in thrallheim all had clocks on them, counting down the time and the distance between us and our destination.

As we finally closed to within a hundred kilometers, the screens changed to a robot’s view of the flank of *Tern*. Lights came on on the other ship’s hull, indicating the docking connector. *Tern* had provided schematics for the mating ring, and—with a groaning sound heard rather louder in the thralls’ hullside bunking-hall than it would be in carlheim or the jarl’s central suite—our little *Owlet* reconfigured a portion of its hull, opposite the main thruster, to match.

We docked. The sound rang throughout our hull, a single low *gong*. We thralls cheered. I imagine the higher ranks likewise celebrated.

About an hour later, two carls came to our halls, carrying between them a case of air tanks and quick-printed breather masks. One of them, Jonasson, handed them out, two tanks and a mask for each thrall. “We’ll be going aboard,” the other carl, Mendelsdótr, told us, her voice calm but her demeanor betraying an excitement that we all felt infecting us. “Wear parkas. It’s probably cold aboard.”

“Why the masks?” one of the thralls asked.

Jonasson smirked like we should already know the answer. Mendelsdótr said, “*Tern* has assured us that there is air aboard, but it cannot assure us that pathogens do not infect it. Until we can sample its air, we will breathe from tanks.”

\#

The records our ancestors brought from Earth are now corrupted archives and codices fogged with bit-rot, but the code archaeologists pieced together fragmentary references to an argosy of slower-than-light generation ships, launched from the homestead world in dozens of different directions. Each ship was named after an Earth bird: the swan, the eagle, the goose, the tern. They would plod through the endless night while generations were born, lived, and died within their hulls. They would take centuries, even millennia to reach their promised new homelands. I couldn’t imagine volunteering to be one of their inhabitants.

Our ancestors, the original colonizers of Eyja, had frog-jumped these slower ships, using faster-than-light leap-drive technology developed later. When the first Eyjans, my great-great-great-grandfather’s generation, stepped onto the surface of their new world, after less than a decade’s transit time, long-forgotten *Tern* was still well over a century away, crawling along at a bit less than two percent of the speed of light.

\#

*Q: \[Consults notes.\] You said it took a week to reach Falið. To reach* Tern. *Why did you not simply leap there? The trip should have taken only moments.*

A: I take it you’ve never gone viking.

*Q: No. I’ve never left Eyja.*

A: You can’t leap far in a solar system. There’s too much gravitational uncertainty. So it took a week because we could only leap a few light-minutes at a time, and then the subroutines would need to calculate the next leap. \[Hesitates.\] Besides, I think none of us were in a particular rush to get there. The unknown. You know? \[Smiles.\]

\#

The first surprise was that there was no gravity on board *Tern*. Five of the thralls couldn’t handle it. Neither could Jonasson, who, for all his smirking and hauteur, was the first to vomit in his mask.

For my own part, my stomach lurched as I crossed from *Owlet*‘s artificial gravity into *Tern*‘s null-g. It took a moment to convince my body that it wasn’t falling, endlessly falling, due to smash on a ground that never came. In the end it was a matter of convincing myself to trust my eyes—showing me that the walls, the floors, the ceilings weren’t rushing at me—instead of my ears, which tried to convince me they were.

(On the second and third visits, of course, we received balms from *Owlet*‘s dispensary to ease the transition from gravity to weightlessness, but on that first visit we had to rely on our own innate resources.)

The antechamber we entered was dimly lit, a spectrum bluer than Gulur, whiter than Auga. Labels everywhere were printed in what Mendelsdótr told us was likely Russlisch, an archaic language of Earth. Some of the characters looked almost like our runes: a hagl, a raið, a reversed sowil. But they formed nonsense syllables, words that meant nothing.

I saw thin dark smoke or perhaps mist curling along the walls, the floor. I blinked and it was gone, leaving me thinking it must have been a trick of the light.

“*Tern*?” Mendelsdótr said.

“Yes,” the ship replied.

\#

*Q: The ship spoke Eyjan?*

A: No. It seemed I could speak Russlisch.

*Q: Ah, of course.*

A: \[Leans forward.\] But I *ca**n’t* speak Russlisch. I’ve never learned it.

*Q: Of course you have. You’re a jarl’s son. You would be educated in the classics.*

A: That makes no sense. They dug Russlisch out of an old, half-rotted archive, and there was so much linguistic drift that it took *Owl*‘s subroutines *six hours* to learn it well enough to communicate with *Tern*. Six hours. That’s an eternity for an AI.

Russlisch is *not* a classic language. It’s an *alien* language.

*Q: Hmm. \[Pauses.\] Nevertheless.*

\#

Mendelsdótr frowned. “*Tern*,” she said again.

“Yes,” the ship said again, patient and unwavering.

Mendelsdótr turned to one of the other thralls, the one carrying the heavy communication bag strapped to her back. In the current environment it floated loosely, its straps slack on her shoulders. “Ciarasdótr,” she said, and I was fleetingly impressed that she knew her thralls’ names, that she didn’t just bark out *comm-thrall*. “Call *Owlet*. Tell Jarl Églisson we need a proxy into the linguistic subroutine. We brought the Russlisch libraries with us from *Owl*, right? Because—”

“We don’t need it,” I said.

Mendelsdótr’s gaze snapped to me. Her motion was so sudden that it started her rotating, and she threw out a hand to slow herself. “What?” she said, her voice sharp.

Ciarasdótr hesitated, the comm bag half unstrapped.

“We don’t need a proxy,” I said. “*Tern* has said ‘yes’ to you twice.”

In the silence that followed I could hear my own breathing, the soft whirring of everyone’s breathers. The soft mysterious sounds of the slowboat all around us.

“You… understood it?” Mendelsdótr had managed to stop her rotation.

“Yes.” I took a breath. “I don’t know how, but… I do.”

“Good. That’s good.” She considered me for a moment. “Will you speak to it?” She could have ordered me to, but she asked instead.

“What do you want to know?”

“This was a generation ship. Where are all the people?”

“Where are the people?” I said, in Russlisch. In a language that I couldn’t possibly know.

“The people are no longer here.”

“Any of them? They’re all dead?”

“The people are no longer here.”

“What happened to them?”

“The people are no—”

“I know,” I said, feeling a little irritable. But this was just a subroutine, and probably less sophisticated than the ones available to me via *Owlet* and *Owl*. It was, at heart, a stimulus-response machine. I just needed to find the correct stimulus.

“Where are they?”

“Everywhere,” *Tern* said, in that same patient, affectless voice.

“What did it say?” Mendelsdótr said.

“They’re dead,” I said. “A long time ago.”

\#

We broke into triads. From the antechamber, corridors fanned out like spokes from a half-wheel. All were lit, that same dimly blue light.

“Go as far as you can,” Mendelsdótr said as Ciarasdótr passed bracelets to each of us. “Scan what you can. Keep your bracelets on, and be sure to check them. If the light turns yellow”—mine shone a soft green, all around its circumference—”you’ve reached the limits of contact. Turn back. If it turns red, you’ve lost contact with us. Return at once if that happens. Do you understand?”

“Já,” we chorused.

“We will signal you when it’s time to return to *Owlet*. When your bracelet pulses thusly”—she touched a control on the comm package on Ciarasdótr’s back, and my wrist throbbed, briefly, unpleasantly—”return at once. Do you understand?”

“Já.”

“Go then,” she said, and we went.

\#

We three—Pjerresson, Tórquellsson, and I—soared through a space that must have been a galley, a large room full of chairs and tables abutting a kitchen with pots and shining knives. We asked each other questions we couldn’t answer.

*Why is there no gravity?*

*Did the ship used to spin?*

*How did everyone die?*

\#

And now I drifted alone in a long corridor lined with gaily painted doors. I didn’t know where the other two were, or maybe I didn’t *want* to know. I had confused memories of smoke or perhaps mist, curling dark along the walls, the floor, the ceiling. Anytime I focused too long on it, my mind shied away.

This must be where the people lived, I thought. A warren of small rooms, each door a work of art: cherubs and nudes, landscapes and geometric abstracts. I wondered which room I was looking for. I knew I’d recognize it when I saw it, but I hadn’t seen it yet.

My bracelet was black, inert, the rim-lights gone out an age ago. Dark as the smoke that had— No.

Some of the doors were open, some ajar, others locked fast. This one, I thought, stopping at a muted sylvan scene, forest and pale sky. It raised a strange nostalgia in me, a longing for something I’d never known.

I floated into the room.

Empty, cold, filled with the same wan bluish light that suffused every place I’d been on this ship.

I pushed off from the doorway and floated above two beds, their dressings pulled up tight, neat and tidy. I put out a hand to stop myself at the wall.

A woman stood on the floor, looking up at me.

*Hrafn,* she said to me, *we need to talk*.

\#

I woke up in motion, which seemed odd at first, until I realized I probably *wasn’t* moving, that I was just forgetting I was in zero gravity.

My wrist throbbed. The light was yellow. “Return,” a thin and thready voice said, “return.”

Bright shining knives: the galley. In the corridor beyond, I kicked from wall to ceiling to wall to floor. There was a freedom here, something I’d never felt before, something I’d only ever approached in Skínandivatn, the shining lake on my father’s estate. But in Skínandivatn there was no air to breathe. Here I could float *and* breathe.

I was the last to arrive back at the antechamber. Mendelsdótr did a quick roll call, and then the nine of us formed up, entered the docking ring, and passed back into *Owlet*, with its bright yellow light and its constant weight and its smells of supper that made my mouth water.

In the thralls’ dining hall, a thought came to me, so sudden and shocking that I spoke it aloud: “Wait. Where are Pjerresson and Tórquellsson?”

The thrall behind me, Ciarasdótr, said, “Who?”

\#

The thralls’ access to *Owlet*‘s subroutines was severely limited: we were allowed entertainments and time-delayed messaging back to Eyja, for those of us with loved ones we wanted to keep in touch with. Jarl Églisson didn’t trust us with anything more. So there was no way for me to check the roster, to see if I’d imagined two thralls, their names known only, it seemed, to me; their faces already fading from my memory.

No one else remembered them at all.

I wondered if anyone else would remember speaking with a woman named Mari, dark-haired and clear-eyed. But I dared not ask anyone, because they already thought I might be crazy.

\#

Ship’s night came too quickly. I didn’t want to sleep, for fear of what dreams might come. But when I did finally nod off, I didn’t dream at all.

In the morning, we returned to *Tern*. Fortified by Owlet’s anti-vertigo balm, Jonasson boarded first, floating free in the antechamber. All fourteen thralls followed, with Mendelsdótr floating rearguard.

I found I could read the labels today, though the words held little meaning, as I lacked the context behind them: O2 SURGE. RING LOCK. TORQUE SUPPRESSOR.

Jonasson knew none of our names, pointing, waving vaguely, calling us *you* or *thrall*. At his command, trios of thralls split off and floated away. Today we carried bags of comm repeaters and syringes of glue, and we were to travel down each corridor to the point where our bracelets turned yellow, then return ten or twenty meters—however far it took to turn green again—and there fix a repeater to the wall. Then repeat, repeat, repeat till the bracelets throbbed to call us home. The goal was to make a mesh network of as much of *Tern*‘s corridors as possible, to ensure that subsequent explorations would have consistent communications.

Today Ciarasdótr was on a team with two other thralls, and a man named Grigorisson wore the comm bag.

After a while, there were only Grigorisson, Jonasson, Mendelsdótr, and me left. Jonasson said, “All right. You’re, uh, Sylviasdótr. Já?”

“Já.” Something fluttered in my stomach, something nothing to do with the weightlessness. He knew *my* name. I didn’t think that was a good thing.

“You’re with me. Let’s go.”

\#

I smeared glue on the flat back of a repeater and pressed it to the wall next to the door.

Carl Jonasson said, “Pjerresson.” I looked over my shoulder at him. I had to hold the repeater in place at least twenty seconds, to ensure a bond.

Jonasson, reading from the face of a small device, said, “Tórquellsson.”

I waited, but he didn’t say anything more. He didn’t look at me, just kept gazing at the pale blue screen in his hand. I got the sense he was waiting for me to react, gauging my—what? Guilt? Complicity?

*Was* I complicit in something? If I was, I didn’t understand it.

I waited, silent, watching him. His hair, longer and lighter than mine, had come partly free of the gold rings he’d bound it in, haloing his face.

Finally he said, “That glue’s set by now.”

“Já,” I said.

The dark-haired woman walked down the corridor toward us. Her footfalls made no sound.

“I looked them up,” he said. We floated down the corridor. The next door’s plaque read EIGHT GALAXY. “The thralls you named. Do you know what I found?”

“No,” I said. “How could I?”

He ignored my insolence, which felt dangerous. He might be filing it away, to castigate me later. “I found *nothing*. They don’t exist. Not in *Owlet*‘s roster, anyway. I’ve made a proxy request to *Owl*‘s crew roster, but the response hasn’t come yet.”

NINE CHANTRY. The woman watched our approach with benevolent eyes. As we passed overhead, she dissolved into dark smoke.

“How is it, do you think, that you remember two thralls, while *no one* *else—not even the subroutines—thinks they ever existed*?”

I didn’t have to answer that, because the smoke filled the corridor, roiling, foaming, and engulfed him.

\#

My bracelet had been pulsing a long time. I couldn’t decide if it was growing weaker or if I was growing numb to it.

I felt lost. This corridor didn’t seem familiar at all. It was very long, so long it followed the curvature of the hull. Doors at regular intervals were all closed to me. Strange names on plaques: THIRTY-NINE HABITUDE; THIRTY-EIGHT QUIRE.

I wondered if *Owlet* would leave me behind, if they might think me perished. If *Owl* would likewise depart, bound back to Eyja, leaving me here, alone on this ghost ship, forever orbiting Falið.

TWENTY-SIX HALL. TWENTY-FIVE CHARM.

A woman walked on the floor as I floated, keeping pace with me. I had the sense she’d answer any questions I had, but I didn’t think I wanted the answers.

FOURTEEN MORTAR. THIRTEEN ENGINE.

And there, finally, something familiar. The smooth bulge of a comms repeater, glued messily to the wall. A single small light burned green on its base.

EIGHT GALAXY. SEVEN MANOR. SIX ABJURE. FIVE HÔPITAL.

\#

I burst at last into the antechamber, finding the other thirteen thralls milling about, floating in disarray. Carl Mendelsdótr made a halfhearted attempt to queue them up, but they ignored her..

“*There* you are,” she said. “At last. Welcome back. Shall we go?”

“…Já?” I said.

“After you, Carl,” she said.

“My name—” I began.

“I know,” she said.

\#

Back aboard *Owlet*, I pulled open the thralls’ door. Before I could enter the corridor, though, Mendelsdótr caught my arm. She pulled me aside as the other thralls flowed past, and hissed in my hear, as if she was afraid they’d overhear, “What are you doing?”

I couldn’t answer. I just stared at her.

After the last one had entered and the door had swung shut, she continued, “Get it together, man. Carls don’t go uninvited into thrallheim any more than thralls come to carlheim.”

“I— *what?*“

She gave me an appraising look, her head tilted slightly. “Are you feeling all right?” In a gesture that reminded me of my mother—Sylvia, my birth mother—she reached up to feel my forehead.

I recoiled from her touch. “I’m *fine*,” I said, though of course I wasn’t. “I’m starting to wonder about everyone else, though.”

“What do you mean?”

“We’ve lost two people, and I seem to be the only one who remembers them.” However hazily. I recalled their surnames—Pjerresson and Tórquellsson—but their forenames, if I’d ever known them, were gone. And their faces were blurring in my memory. I was pretty sure Tórquellsson had had dark hair.

Wait.

“Jonasson,” I said, like it was a revelation.

“No,” she said, “my name is—”

I held up a hand. “Where’s Jonasson?”

\#

A: You’ve been asking all the questions. Now I’d like to put one to you.

*Q: This is a colloquy, not an interrogation, Mr. Sylviasdótr. I thought that had been made clear. Please, ask me anything, and I will answer as best I can.*

A: This is a question I rather thought *you* might ask *me*. How was it that I left *Owlet* as a thrall, yet returned as a carl?

*Q: There are many paths* *out* *of* *thralldom. Aside from outright purchase of manumission, of course, there are routes via community service, penance, philanthropy—*

A: \[Interrupts.\] Yes, but none of those would take less than a day. Correct?

*Q: I suppose.*

A: But you don’t have any problems with this part of the story? You just—*accept* that I became a carl, in mere hours? With no currency changing hands?

*Q: \[Hesitates.\] I… there must have been a reason.*

A: I feared you’d say that.

\#

The door into carlheim was oak, like the thrallsdoor, but sandwiched in its center was a gleaming layer of steel. When Mendelsdótr closed it behind us, I heard a soft *chunk* sound of bolts locking it in place.

I’d given up asking questions of her. Everything I said was met with a mild gaze, as though she was being patient with me. And moments later, it seemed she’d forget the question, forget my protests.

It was like she’d been hypnotized to simply accept that I was one of them. That I was a carl now, having done nothing to earn it.

Each door off the corridor, here, was also oak. In thrallheim there were few doors. Some of us hung bedsheets from lintels for privacy.

Each cabin here had its own nameplate. When Mendelsdótr showed me mine—seeming exasperated that I didn’t know my own way there—it said SYLVIASDÓTR on the LCD nameplate. But where every other cabin door was written in Eyjan runes, mine was in the strange Russlisch lettering.

I stood alone in the corridor for a long time, unwilling to enter the cabin.

\#

In the supper-hall, I sat with two strangers, two carls who had so far not boarded *Tern*. While I told them what had happened to me, they nodded sagely, frowning slightly at times. When I’d finished, one of them, Roberrisson, said, “Well, that’s just the way of it. Isn’t it?”

The other, Klarasdótr, sipped her spiced mead and belched softly. “Yep. Suppose it is.”

I gawped at them a moment, food forgotten. “Are you— *what do you mean?*” In my peripheral vision, I saw a couple of carls at other tables look over at me. Stop shouting, I told myself.

“What?” Klarasdótr said, taken aback by my fierce demeanor.

I got my voice under control before I spoke again. “I’m a thrall,” I said.

“If you were a thrall,” Roberrisson said, calmly, in a voice you’d use to explain to a child, “you wouldn’t be here in the carlheim.”

\#

Back at Jonasson’s cabin—”my” cabin—I found that, again, I didn’t want to enter the room. I hesitated in the hallway for a long time, then—because I felt eyes on me—finally took a deep breath and crossed the threshold.

A single bed, wider and longer than the bunk I’d had in thrallheim, stood in the center of the room. Blue sheets, the color of the carapace that covered an owl’s forewings, lay messily on the bed. Jonasson wasn’t in the habit of making his bed. I can’t sleep here, I thought.

\#

After ship’s night fell I lay awake a long time. When I was sure the carls must all be asleep, I slipped out of carlheim, back into *Owlet*‘s docking antechamber. I hesitated before the thralls’ door—what if I was going crazy? What if I’d never really been a thrall?

With a quick, sudden motion, I opened the door—so light, after the steel-cored carls’ door—and plunged inside. The door swung shut behind me, latching with a soft click.

The darkness was absolute.

It shouldn’t have been. Even in the darkest moments of ship’s night, soft lights ran along the bases of the walls, a steady glow to provide enough light to find one’s way, whether carl or thrall.

I stood still in the corridor, listening to my heart beating. I took a shuffling step, another, hands outstretched to deflect me from the walls, should I get too close.

But the walls, I realized, weren’t there. I was in a black and empty vastness, and slowly, as my eyes adjusted, I saw there *was* light here, the light a miner might see standing at the bottom of a shaft and gazing up at one of the lesser moons. A dim shimmer that, if I didn’t know better, I might mistake for the flicker of my nerve cells, trying to parse something, *anything*, out of the darkness.

The floor had fallen away, or maybe it had never been there. I soared toward the light, slowly but accelerating.

It was the woman from *Tern*. Mari.

*Hello again, Hrafn*, she said.

“Who are you?”

*Mari,* she said.

“I know that,” I said. “But who *are* you?”

*I’m like you,* she said. *Or rather, you’re like me. You’re the one it’s chosen.* She looked sad, so sad.

“What happened to you?”

Her eyes darkened. *We met something. In the long dark between stars, we met something, and it didn’t like us. In the end it destroyed us.*

Wake up, I thought. Wake up.

But if this was a dream, it wasn’t done with me yet.

“What… what was it?”

*We* *never knew for sure. Some of us thought it was we ourselves, unready for such a long journey through the dark; others thought it was something else, something that came from without and insinuated into us,* became *us. If you can see the difference.*

I didn’t know what to say to that.

*It—* She hesitated. *It* infected *us.* With a shudder, visible in reflection: *It infected* them*. They couldn’t see it, but I could. It looked like, like foam.* *Like a dark mist.*

“Like smoke,” I said.

She nodded. *It… ate them.* *Devoured them.* *One at a time,* *at* *first.*

*They couldn’t tell what was happening, and neither could I. Every day there were fewer of them remaining. No one but me seemed to remember the lost ones.*

*It didn’t just infect the people. It infected the sapient systems, which is to say all the systems that mattered. I started to wonder if maybe I’d gone mad, if I was remembering things that didn’t happen. It wasn’t until I taught myself how to read the raw data streams**—untouched by the sapient systems—**that I was sure of what was happening.*

I wondered if *Tern*‘s neutral voice was the endpoint of a sapient system.

I wondered if *Tern* was infected. Could the infection spread to *Owlet*?

*There came a day when I was the only one left. I’m still not sure I didn’t* become *it in the end.*

\#

I woke up in Jonasson’s cabin. Of *course* I did.

Had I dreamed last night’s encounter?

In the dining hall, I sat with a couple of carls, one a stranger, one Klarasdótr from the night before. I ate in silence, letting them talk about whatever carls’ business they had to work out with each other.

*We met something, and it didn’t like us.*

“We can’t go back,” I said.

The other two at my table both looked at me. Klarasdótr said, “*Tern*‘s less than two-ninths explored. Of *course* we’re going back.”

I stood up, no longer hungry. “I need to speak to Jarl Églisson,” I said.

\#

The jarl’s door was more solid still than the carls’ door, the steel sandwiched between the oak laminars twice the thickness of the carls’ door. The cabin beyond was a multi-roomed luxury. I wondered if the ship’s-queen aboard *Owl* would live in a golden palace with a vault door two hands thick.

Jarl Églisson indicated a plush seat, and I sat. He sat opposite me, shirtless, intense. I had, to judge by the sheen of sweat on him, interrupted a fitness routine.

“What is it, Carl… Sylvias*dótr*, isn’t it?”

*Thrall*, I almost said, but some instinct stopped me. “The ship,” I said. “*Tern*. We shouldn’t— we can’t go back.”

“Why do you say that?”

“It’s haunted,” I said. It’s infected, I didn’t say

He gave me a long, level stare, the kind of consideration you might give a salted perch on the plate before eating it. “Haunted,” he said, eventually.

“I know how it sounds—” I began.

“No,” he said. “Wait there. I need to see this for myself.” He turned away from me and strode to a second door. A few minutes later, he emerged, dressed in a more elaborately-decorated version of the plain jumpsuit I wore. “Haste, man,” he said. “This is no time to tarry.” He clapped his hands, sharply, and I sprang from the chair.

In the corridor he took the lead, long strides, boots clacking on the tiled floors. We emerged into *Owlet*‘s docking antechamber to find the squad already assembled.

Carl Mendelsdótr recognized me first, and said, “Ah, Sylviasdótr, there you—” She stopped as she realized who the other newcomer was. “Beg your pardon, Jarl,” she stammered. “I was about to reprimand Carl Sylviasdótr”—I still was unused to the sound of that—”but if he was in your service—”

Églisson waved a magnanimous hand. “All is forgiven,” he said easily, but anyone who knew his history would suspect that the slight—any slight, even an imagined one—had been stored away for future prosecution. “I have decided, in light of the stories Mr. Sylvias*dótr* has brought to me, to join today’s explorations.”

Mendelsdótr’s mouth dropped open. Just for a second, but surely the jarl took note, adding it to the list of her small transgressions.

“Of course, Jarl,” she said. “I was about to assign teams, but if you’d prefer—?”

“No,” he said, “I trust your expertise. I pray that you match me with Carl Sylvias*dótr*, though of course I leave it to your discretion.”

She nodded, slowly, eyes considering me.

Jarl Églisson, so far as I knew, had not availed himself of *Owlet*‘s pharmacy. He didn’t seem affected by the lack of gravity, though, and in fact tumbled through it with more skill than I, who had had two days’ practice already. I wondered if he or his family owned a space habitat.

“Ghosts, eh,” he said, once we were well clear of anyone else’s earshot.

He said it with no particular inflection, but something in me came alert, perhaps had always been alert.

“Yes,” I said, and to my relief my voice didn’t quaver. “One.”

He wore no bracelet, but a strip in the sleeve of his jumpsuit glowed a soft teal green, like sunlight striking corroded copper. Silver piping lined either side of the indicator strip. In contrast, my bracelet looked tawdry.

“You will introduce me to him,” he said, sounding like a man who had come to a decision.

“Her. She speaks Russlisch.”

“I have heard that you speak Russlisch as well, thanks to your esoteric classical education. I trust you to translate faithfully.”

I bit back a protest, and nodded instead. No one else had believed that I had no education of any sort in Russlisch; why would he be the first?

We passed through the galley, he and I, drifting above the tables so clearly set up for a constant-gravity environment. I wondered how long the ship had kept spinning for gravity before the core AIs noticed the humans were all dead. How long they’d let it spin on as a memorial.

\#

In the hall of painted doors, I said, “This is where I first saw her. The ghost.” I was surprised to find the place actually existed. I had wondered if perhaps I’d only dreamed it.

“What is her name?”

“Mari.”

“Is she here?”

“No,” I said. But then she stepped out of a door, a closed door with an ouroboros on it, a great scaled serpent in a figure-8 with its own tail in its mouth. “Yes.”

“Well? What are you waiting for?”

“Mari,” I said.

*Hello, Hrafn,* she said.

In Russlisch, I said, “This is Jarl Églisson. He is the leader of our team.”

*Have you brought him as sacrifice?* she said.

Églisson’s eyes bored into me. “She says ‘Welcome’,” I said.

In the corner of my eye, something moved.

“Is she alone? Are there others?”

*It will not save you..*

Whatever it was curled along the floor, the walls, the ceiling, spreading like smoke, darkening the edges, dulling the light. It came… it came, I realized at last, from Mari.

“Are you alone?” I asked. “He wants to know if there are other… other ghosts.”

Églisson didn’t seem to see it. I wondered if I was *really* seeing it, or just imagining it.

Mari had almost entirely dissolved, now, into smoke. I *cannot control what comes next,* her voice said, her tone full of melancholy.

The light went out. I couldn’t tell if it was a power failure or if the smoke had occluded it.

For a second I think Églisson saw it too, because he began to scream.

\#

I woke up tumbling through the galley, heels over head. I caromed off a wall and felt nothing.

I looked at my bracelet, where my bracelet had been, and found a silver-edged line of soft green light in a jumpsuit sleeve.

Of course, I thought. Of course.

\#

I was the last to return. Mendelsdótr saw me, saw my jumpsuit, and a question crossed her face. She opened her mouth, and I prayed she’d ask it.

Then it went away. Something drained away, something in her eyes. “Ah,” she said, instead of *How are you a jarl now?* “Welcome back. Did you find what you were looking for?”

“Da,” I said, which means “yes” in Russlisch. I wanted to see if the change in language would jar her out of the reverie, the fugue everyone seemed to experience around me.

Perhaps it was too close to “já”, because she only nodded. “We’d best get back then,” she said. “With your permission, of course.”

\#

In jarlheim, I explored the suite. Jarl Églisson’s suite featured a small exercise room with a gravity dial that went from 0 through Eyjan standard to 3x Eyjan. I stepped into the room before I saw the dial, and staggered and almost fell. It was set to 1.8; I rolled it back to 1.0.

The bed was larger, by far, than the carls’ beds. The bedroom alone was the size of a carl’s room.

I used the washroom with relief, and then glanced into the other two rooms: a den with shelves decorated with the fake spines of classic books, the walls papered with a wraparound screen that showed the stars as seen from a dark Eyjan field; and a small white room whose function I couldn’t identify.

A chime sounded. I looked around. Had I tripped some alarm? After a moment, it sounded again. “What *is* that?” I said aloud, not expecting a reply.

A voice said, “Your supper has arrived.”

“Who said that?”

“I am *Owlet*,” the voice said. “Specifically I am the seneschal subroutine assigned to jarlheim.”

“Ah,” I said. “What’s the white room?”

Patient as any teacher, *Owlet* said, “That is the control chamber.”

“Control chamber?”

“For the ship.” Of course, I thought. As the highest-ranked person on *Owlet*, the jarl would command the ship.

The chime sounded a third time.

The carl at the door gave me a strange look, like she’d expected someone else in the jarl’s jumpsuit. Then her expression softened like something melting. She handed me a covered bowl. I thanked her. She turned to go.

The smoke came up from the floors, the walls, and when it receded she was gone.

The bowl was full of steaming soup. It smelled delicious but I wasn’t hungry, not any more. I set it down and entered the white room.

Inside was a molded stool, a blank console, and a soft light. I sat on the stool and closed the door. The console lit up.

“Let’s go home,” I said.

\#

I dreamt of Mari, becoming smoke.

*It…* infected *us.*

I dreamt of Églisson’s scream, cut off as the smoke entered his mouth, his soundless writhing, his strange dissolution. In the dreams his face shifted, became Jonasson’s face, Pjerresson’s, Torquellsson’s. Mari’s.

*Something that came from without and insinuated into us,* became *us.*

Mari’s bright eyes.

*I’m still not sure I didn’t* become *it.*

Mari, dissolving into smoke.

*It will not save you.*

\#

“We have seen enough,” I said to the carls assembled in their hall. We were already a third of the way back to *Owl*. “*Tern* is a threat and must be destroyed. We are returning to *Owl*, where I report to ship’s-queen Iðunnsdótr personally.” A sense of a collective breath, held in anticipation of seeing who the jarl would scapegoat, being let out.

The smoke curled in, and in that moment I finally, finally understood.

\#

*Q:* Tern *was worth a fortune in salvage, never mind the historical value. Why would you destroy it?*

A: You dare ask me about the value of that ship? Whatever *value* it held was second to the… the thing. The smoke, the demon. I wanted it destroyed.

\#

*Owlet* rejoined *Owl*. If I was smart, I mused, waiting for the larger ship to reabsorb the shuttle, if I was brave, if I was *able*, I’d have plunged *Owlet* into Falið’s atmosphere, or opened the locks and drowned myself in vacuum.

I was none of those things. And so the thralls in the outer hulls of *Owl* were taken by the smoke. The carls in their halls and the jarls in jarlheim, as I made my way inward, toward the ship’s-queen’s manse.

\#

The thickest door I’d ever seen barred the way into the manse, the fortress at *Owl*‘s heart. I stood at attention for a long time while security subroutines considered my request. Cold logic, processing a trillion instructions a second. A minute was an eternity to them.

*It infected the sapient systems, which is to say all the systems that mattered.*

They admitted me, as I’d feared they would.

\#

I’d assumed the ship’s-queen would look like an angel, shining and ethereal, but she was a tall, stern woman with iron-grey hair and watchful eyes. “Jarl… Sylviasdótr?”

“Yes,” I said.

“You would have us destroy *Tern*, we hear. Because…” She let it hang.

“There’s not time for a full explanation,” I said. Or comprehension, I feared. “The ship is haunted, and we cannot afford to bring that haunting back to Eyja.”

Tendrils of smoke curled along the baseboards. I wanted to scream.

“Our expedition to *Tern* involves a significant investment in time, matériel, and expertise. Convincing us to throw all that away on the word of a jarl is an uphill battle. We’re sure you understand.”

*Of course*, I wanted to say, but the smoke, unbidden, unheeding, poured out from me. It enveloped her.

When it receded she was gone.

\#

I ordered *Tern* to de-orbit, and had *Owl*—for it was my ship now—deploy a swarm of robots, cameras and network repeaters. I watched the ghost ship burn, and felt I’d done the right thing, the noble thing.

Even though I knew it didn’t matter, that I was the smoke now.

I desperately wanted to order *Owl* to leap into Gulur, to burn up in the crushing heart of our sun.

I could not.

Hating myself, loathing my every word, I instead ordered a course home to Eyja, the quickest one the subroutines could calculate.

Because as much as I want to keep Eyja safe, I also want to devour.

*Q: \[Disappears in smoke.\]*

A: \[Stands. Walks out of the empty room.\]
