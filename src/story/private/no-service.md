# No Service

David, in the living room, turned the radio’s dial through its entire range, back and forth and back again. “Nothing,” he said. “And no service on our phones.”

“Well,” Sam said, “we *did* come here to get away from it all.”

“Yeah,” he said, only half listening. Static, only static.

She came out of the bedroom wearing her bikini and snapped off the radio. “Let’s go swimming.”

She went off the dock headfirst, into the lake spangled with sunlight. Her fingers grazed the muddy bottom, then she strove for the bright surface.

David, on the dock, was staring at the sky.

“What?” she said, but before he could reply, she saw it: pale, *impossible* green light, dancing. She’d never seen the aurora before, not in person, and she’d *never* heard of it appearing in daylight.

She swam to the dock, pulled herself out of the water, sat next to him. “Must be a hell of a solar storm,” she said. He looked at her, as if only now realizing how smart she was. “No wonder there’s no radio.”

He nodded.

They sat there till the sun went down and the sky lit up with green fire.
