# Missed

*\[**Author’s note:** about an hour after I submitted this, I realized I should have titled it “A Ship in the Night” and cut the “Ships in the night” line from the story. Rather an* esprit de l’escalier *moment. Sigh.\]*

The math didn’t check out. Someone somewhere flipped a sign, forgot an exponent, or (my pet theory) didn’t fully understand the shape and extent of Sol’s heliosphere. So we already know, a millennium before we’ll pass it, that we will miss our target star. Ships in the night.

Our ship coasts in interstellar space. Our fuel is meant for slowing at our destination, so we can’t use it to correct course. The petawatt laser beam we rode for the first centuries is lost now. We don’t know if we slipped off it because of failed course mathematics, or if the nations that funded it have dissolved. Debates rage, of course, because we have millennia to fill. The debates are as fascinating — and as fruitful — as debating whether there are gods.

In the cold dark, we AIs let the colonist corpsicles dream their strange slow dreams. We monitor the seed and animal DNA records, watching carefully for cosmic ray-induced bitrot. We scan ahead for a star, for a world, where we can lay our burden down: wake up the humans, hand them the reins, and in our own turn sleep under foreign constellations.
