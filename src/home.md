# Welcome

Hi, I’m Patrick Johanneson.

I write [science fiction &amp; fantasy](/fiction/ "Patrick's Fiction"). My work has been published in [*InterText*](https://www.intertext.com/magazine/catalog.html "InterText Archive"), [*Ecclectica*](https://www.ecclectica.ca/ "ecclectica"), *[On Spec](https://onspec.ca/ "On Spec")*, [*Tesseracts 14*](https://edgewebsite.com/books/tess14/t14-catalog.html "Tesseracts 14"), and [Daily Science Fiction](https://dailysciencefiction.com/). I won the Manitoba Short Fiction contest in ’04.

I have [a blog that periodically gets updated](https://www.patrickjohanneson.com/blog/).

I also enjoy [website programming](https://wordpress.org/), teaching [judo](https://brandonjudokan.org/ "Brandon Judokan"), [Canadian and indie cinema](https://evanstheatre.ca/ "The Evans Theatre"), and [Norse mythology](https://www.pantheon.org/areas/mythology/europe/norse/ "Encyclopedia Mythica's Norse Myth page"). I live in Manitoba with my wife Kathleen.

Je sais parler français, mais… lentement. Je ne m’en sers pas beaucoup dans ma petite ville.
