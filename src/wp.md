# WordPress

WordPress runs this site. WordPress is the CMS that I use at work.

This little area of my site is a small development area to hold plugins and/or themes that I’m working on. Nothing here is fit for production; nothing here has any warranty. This code is, at best, alpha-level.

*You Have Been Warned.*

(If any of this makes it into WordPress’s plugin or theme directories, I will be ecstatic.)
