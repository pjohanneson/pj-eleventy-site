# About Patrick

Patrick Johanneson writes prairie-flavoured [science fiction &amp; fantasy](/fiction/). His work has been published in *[On Spec](http://onspec.ca/)*, [*Tesseracts 14*](http://edgewebsite.com/books/tess14/t14-catalog.html), [Daily Science Fiction](http://dailysciencefiction.com/), and [*Parallel Prairies*](https://www.greatplains.mb.ca/product/parallelprairies/), among others. He won the Manitoba Short Fiction contest in ’04.

He’s also a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) [Multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/create-a-network/) maven, a [judo](http://brandonjudokan.org/) instructor and referee, an aficionado of [Canadian and indie cinema](http://evanstheatre.ca/), and a lover of [Norse mythology](https://pantheon.org/mythology/norse/).

Il sait parler français, mais… lentement. Il ne s’en sert pas beaucoup dans sa ville.

Patrick lives in Manitoba with his wife Kathleen. He’s on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/patrickjohanneson), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pjohanneson), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj), and intermittently [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pjohanneson/).
