# Critiquing

Some quick guidelines for critiquing in the WMRL Writing programme:

Be helpful.
-----------

Offer constructive criticism. Offer encouragement. Put yourself in the other writer’s shoes.

Critique the writing…
---------------------

…not the writer.

Give the writer what she asks for.
----------------------------------

If someone wants grammar and spelling checking, and nothing else, then give them grammar and spelling checking. If someone wants to know what works for you and what doesn’t, then tell them. If they want both, then feel free to deliver both.
