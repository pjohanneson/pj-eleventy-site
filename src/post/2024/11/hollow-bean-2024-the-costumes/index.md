From 5:30pm to 8:30pm last night((Which was, we realized, the 25th anniversary of the day we moved into the house)), we had 16 trick-or-treaters show up at our place.

- Harlequin with a little hat

- Pig (he wore a burlap overall and had quite the full-head mask going on)

- Pikachu (it was her first Hallowe'en; when her mom said "What do you say?" her first guess was "Candy please?")

- A giant black dot

- The Phantom of the Opera

- Teen who likes candy ×2

- Skull-faced clown

- Zombie mobster

- Delivery drivers who brought us our torta ×2

- Stitch

- Deadpool

- Minions ×2

- Vampire

We turned off the light about 9:20pm, and we've got a bunch of candy left.
