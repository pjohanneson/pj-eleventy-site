I had a dream the other night that I was writing a story about a tower, a wooden tower like you find in national parks at scenic outlooks, but every step on it was a day. If you came down the stairs too quickly you'd find yourself back in time.

When I woke up I held onto it, tweaked it, made it more logical. I've started on a first draft, because a gift in a dream is still a gift.

> The tower had three hundred and sixty-five steps, but one of them—it was never clear to me which one—was about 25% higher than the rest. My best friend Riley, who went missing for a week and a half in the summertime and then showed up claiming he'd tripped on the way back down from the top, told me over pie and black coffee in the Chicken Chef that I should always watch my step.
