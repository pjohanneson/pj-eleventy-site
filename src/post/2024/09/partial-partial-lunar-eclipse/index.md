Since our trees no longer block the sky((I see I haven't blogged about that; long story short, one large branch fell, and the arborist recommended we remove both maples. I still miss them.)), I was able to set up a camera on the deck to try and get a timelapse of the moon being partially darkened by Earth's shadow this evening. I went back outside about 10 minutes later to see how it was going, and... Well, clouds had filled the sky. So I managed to get about 4 photos, all told, and above you can see one of them.

Oh well. Like I said to my darling wife, at least I didn't drive twenty minutes just to watch the clouds roll in.
