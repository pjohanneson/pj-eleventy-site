What did I bring to this year's writing retreat?

- 12 Manitoba beers

- 2 laptops

- 2 cameras

- 2 tripods

- more food than I need

- not the coffee grinder, whoops

- my bike

- an assortment of books

- a hope that the forecast is incorrect and at least _one_ night will be cloud-free

And now I'm about to start cooking supper, finishing off the quite bitter((At least it's got cool can art, by [GMB Chomichuk](https://www.gmbchomichuk.ca/).)) [A Necessary Evil](https://www.dastardlyvillain.com/) (which is _definitely_ an IPA), and planning out tonight's writing. (Ghosts? You bet. Starships? Absolutely.)
