# Stormy

We had a big ol’ storm roll through last night. Severe thunderstorm warning from Environment Canada, unending flickerings to the west and north, the whole shebang. I wish I’d taken my camera with me when I went to pick Kathleen up from work; the lightning show peaked while I was waiting in the parking lot, reading *Wizard and Glass* (which is another story), and I have to say, it was amazing. 10:30 at night, and there were moments when the world lit up like it was daytime. Once we were headed home, there was a moment, as we approached the lights for our left turn, that the row of pines that stand across 18th Street from the <s>floodplain</s> Corral Centre were backlit by what looked suspiciously like a strobe light. The lightning was intense, consistent, regular, and plentiful.

Once we got home, I grabbed the camera, hoping to be able to capture some cool images, but the lightshow had faded in favour of a brief but torrential downpour. According to the weather channel, we got about 20mm of rain last night, but it only rained for maybe half an hour.

I tried anyway to get some shots of the lightning, but it seems our little camera wasn’t up to the task. It’s great for snapshots, but I don’t think it’s meant for low light shooting. Oh well….
