Discovered in [worstelen.org](http://www.flickr.com/people/worstelen/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>*Later, in the bar*

“Dude, why did you interview him?”

“C’mon, Johnny, don’t you know who that was? Didn’t you recognize him?”

“No.”

“Johnny, that was *the Green Goblin!* What a scoop!”

“Dave…”

“What?”

“Dave, that wasn’t the Green Goblin. That was some guy in a green mask.”

“…Seriously?”

“Yeah. Seriously.”

“Aw crap, man, that’s like eighty bucks worth of tape I used. That’s gonna come out of my salary.” \[*Drinks a shot of whiskey*\] “Heh, you’re just yankin’ my chain, sure. That was the Green Goblin. I’ll be fine.”

“No, Dave, that was some guy in a mask. Dude, you’re a little too credulous, you have to work on that.”

“Whatever. I suppose you’re gonna tell me that ain’t Wolverine that was tending bar, too, right?”

“Dave, that’s just a guy who needs to trim his fingernails.”
