# Songs I could listen to on infinite repeat:  #1 in a fairly short list

“Here It Is Again” by [Beautiful South](http://www.beautifulsouth.co.uk/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It opens with a headlong rolling bassline. Then a piano starts to tinkle overtop of the bass.

> Here it is again it’s so so mad  
> Turning young and happy into old and sad  
> Here it is again just passed by chance  
> All the way to the lawyer from a sloppy dance  
> It was another holiday argument  
> But she threw him into the sea  
> A glass bottomed boat pulled him up  
> His face was rotting in weed  
> It was rotting in weed, I’ve seen those people bleed  
> If it never happens well it happened to me
> 
> Do you know who you love  
> Does anybody here have a clue  
> Just who they’re with  
> And it was glance by glance  
> And it was blow by blow  
> Did they know  
> Just who they loved

At some point the strings come in. I’m never sure if they’re there before I notice them, or if they’re just inserted so smoothly that I don’t notice when it happens.

> Here it is again in the same disguise  
> Clean shoes, smart tie and deep blue eyes  
> Here it is again and it makes you sick  
> Watch the blind man walk along without a stick  
> Heads he was a beautiful lover  
> Tails he was definitely bad  
> Heads you’re like no other  
> Tails just the best he’d had
> 
> You’re the best he’s had  
> You’re the best so far  
> All the way to the church from the back of a car

The voice is husky and charming, but there’s a sense of urgency to it. You’re never sure if it’s fear or anger or sorrow driving the words. You just know that you need the song to go on longer. Maybe forever.

> Do you know who you love  
> Does anybody here have a clue  
> Just who they’re with  
> And it was glance by glance  
> And it was blow by blow  
> Did they know  
> Just who they loved  
> Just who they loved  
> Just who they loved  
> Just who they loved  
> Just who they loved

And then you press *rewind* and listen to it again, so loud that the bass threatens to destroy your cheap car speakers. Let ’em go. What a way for them to die.

Then you see the girl in the next car, giving you a funny look because she’s caught you singing along. Oh well.
