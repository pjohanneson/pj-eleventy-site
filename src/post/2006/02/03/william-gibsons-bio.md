# William Gibson&#8217;s bio

[Source Code](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp)  
William Gibson’s autobiography is an interesting piece of writing, detailing how and why he became a writer. I re-read this today, and it made me happy.

> Google me and you can learn that I do it all on a manual typewriter, something that hasn’t been true since 1985, but which makes such an easy hook for a lazy journalist that I expect to be reading it for the rest of my life. I only used a typewriter because that was what everyone used in 1977, and it was manual because that was what I happened to have been able to get, for free.

Also, if you haven’t read his poem [Agrippa](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/agrippa.asp), you really should. In my humble opinion, anyway.

Anyways, I’ve got family in town. See ya later!
