# Sledding

<div style="text-align: center">[![Pat](http://static.flickr.com/34/104866854_096ea669bd_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/104866854)  
^ That’s me! ^</div> So today we went sledding after church. It was a blast. More photos at [my flickr site](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/tags/tobogganing/).

Now I hope to do some writing. Probably some more in the story I was working on yesterday.

**Later–**1300 words. Not bad for an hour and a half. Chapter 1 is now complete, and it’s just shy of 3500 words. Nice!
