“At the Hundredth Meridian”, The Tragically Hip

So the other day I bought The Tragically Hip’s “Yer Favourites” double CD. It makes me happy. Like my wife said once: “Of course you like the Hip. You’re a Canadian boy.”

It’s a compilation of fan favourites. If I remember correctly, they polled a bunch of random fans about what their favourite Hip songs were. The result is this two-disc set. There are some great tunes in here, too: “New Orleans is Sinking”, “Little Bones”, “50 Mission Cap”, and almost 40 others too.

“Boots or Hearts”

So how’s *your* music collection?
