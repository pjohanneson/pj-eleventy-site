# Challenges

I’ve taken up a challenge at [Forward Motion](http://www.fmwriters.com/) to do the “Apprentice” level for their May challenge. Basically what it boils down to is that I’ve said I’ll try to write 10 short stories (more than 500 words) in May. If things go well, I’ll up myself to “Journeyman” (15 stories instead of 10), but we’ll see how it goes.

The other thing about the challenge is that at least 80% of the stories *must* come from topics/themes/characters suggested by one or another of a handful of online generators. Because I relish a challenge, I’m going to try and do *all* my stories from generator suggestions.

The one for May the first was:

> The story’s protaganist is female and a gardener. A knife plays a significant part in the story. The story is set in a kitchen in the future. The story is about deception.

And the story for it is [here](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/lost-and-found) (password: <span style="color: #fff">fm</span> &lt;– highlight to read).
