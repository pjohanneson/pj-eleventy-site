# This weekend

This weekend, the May Long Weekend here in Canada, eh, was the Senior National Competition for judo. It took place in Winnipeg, which is just down the road a piece. The head instructor at our club was responsible for the opening ceremonies and the medal presentations, and so a bunch of us from the club volunteered to assist. It was fun, and I found the matches to be rather interesting as well. There was at least one gold medallist from Manitoba, and possibly a second, as well as a handful of bronzes.

I’ve got photos that I’ll be posting before too long, and I’ll be doing a more in-depth post on [our judo club’s website](http://www.brandonjudokan.org/).
