# Can&#8217;t Talk.  Eating.

Some food-related tidbits:

- I made banana loaf the other day, with chocolate chips in it. It’s half gone. Delicious.
- The Velvet Dip opened on Saturday. They have the smoothest soft-serve I’ve ever tasted, leagues above the stuff Dairy Queen provides. (Though, if I didn’t know about the Dip, I’d feel pretty stoked that the DQ was open again for the summer.
- My sister sent me a [vinerterte](http://www.prairiepublic.org/features/ScandTraditions/vinerterte.htm) for my birthday. As far as I’m concerned, food-wise, it’s one of the best things Iceland ever came up with. I have to make the icing, but that’s no great hardship. As long as I still have some amaretto for the flavouring…

- I think I’ll have to stop by the [LC](http://www.mlcc.mb.ca/) for some [Black Wych](http://www.wychwood.co.uk/wychwood_blackwych.htm), which is the best stout I’ve ever tasted. As far as I’m concerned, it even trumps Guinness. Mmm mmm good.

So. How was *your* weekend? Mine’s not done yet. I took Monday and Tuesday off this week.

Yeah, it’s a rough life.
