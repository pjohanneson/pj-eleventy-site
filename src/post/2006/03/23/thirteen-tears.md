# Thirteen Tears

My first-ever Thursday Thirteen.

Thirteen Things about **Patrick Johanneson**

1. Reading the novel *[Circuit of Heaven](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380790920/qid=1142517369)*\* by Dennis Danvers, there was a section that brought a tear to my eye. I couldn’t believe it. I had *never* cried over a *book* before.
2. Seeing my wife in her wedding gown on our wedding day also brought a rush of emotions that included a couple of tears.
3. Reading Stephen King’s *[The Dark Tower](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743254562/qid=1142517550)*, which was the culmination of a fifteen-year odyssey for me as a reader, there was a section that brought the tears welling up, just a little bit. Without any spoilers, I’ll say that it was in the section “In This Haze of Green and Gold”.
4. Especially when paired with Michael Whelan’s painting of the forest.
5. Getting hoofed in the jewels on the playground in about grade 3. That was an eye-opener. (They can’t *all* be sappy.)
6. On our way out of town one day, we were listening to [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/) radio, which was playing stuff from the previous year’s [Winnipeg Comedy Festival](http://www.winnipegcomedyfestival.com/). [Brent Butt](http://www.brentbutt.com/)‘s routine had me laughing so hard I couldn’t see. I actually had to pull the car over to wipe the tears from my eyes.
7. Waking up from a dream that my home was burning, and all my friends were standing around, unwilling to help me, brought a deluge of frightened and frustrated tears.
8. Wiping out on a bike when I was about seven, I think, I managed to skin my knees, the heels of my hands, and I ended up with a nosebleed too. That was the absolute capper. I cried all the way home (I think it must’ve been about three-quarters of a block).
9. Watching the extras on my new *[Serenity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/)* DVD, I laughed so hard I cried. Nathan Filion (Mal) went a little nuts in one of the scenes, delivering gibberish with a straight face. And in a deleted scene, Inara tells Mal that she hopes he “is reincarnated as a polyp”. After a beat, he says, “Is that good?”
10. In the musical *Les Misérables*, [there’s a bit towards the end](http://www.lyricsondemand.com/soundtracks/l/lesmiserableslyrics/weddingchoralebeggarsatthefeastlyrics.html) where Jean Valjean, Eponine, and Fantine sing that “to love another person is to see the face of God”, and every time–every *single* time–that line brings a lump to my throat and a tear to my eye. I couldn’t tell you why.
11. Waking up after my splenectomy at the age of six, all alone in a room full of towels, I couldn’t find my Mom. It scared the crap out of me. I bawled till a nurse came (which probably wasn’t that long, but when you’re six years old, alone in a room full of towels, any time at all is an eternity).
12. *[Dodgeball](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/)*, completely contrary to my expectations, made me laugh till I wept. My brother-in-law wanted to see it, so we went along. It was a great “shut-down-your-brain-and-laugh” film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
13. Remembering some of these items for this list made me feel like I might tear up at some point. Especially #10. I am apparently a sucker for that line…
