# Scary

We all get them: credit-card applications in the mail. I usually rip ’em in half and toss ’em in the recycling. I may have to rethink that technique.

[The Torn-Up Credit Card Application](http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/creditcard/application.shtml)

Long story short: Good ol’ Rob Cockerham, of [cockeyed.com](http://www.cockeyed.com/), tore up a credit card app, taped it back together, sent it off–*and received a credit card*. Yikes.
