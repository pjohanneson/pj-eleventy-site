# The Ides of March

[It seems I have a great deal to learn about sailing ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sail-plan) in order to grant my NiP the desired degree of versimilitude. Good thing I have the Nonsuch book from 1970ish. It seems to have a wealth of detail. And where it may falter, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketch) can pick up the slack.

Off to write and do research!
