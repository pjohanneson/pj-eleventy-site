# In like a lion

<div align="center">[![March 1st](http://static.flickr.com/48/106510977_ea7db5b599_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/106510977)</div>…eventually.

They’ve been calling for heavy snowfall all day. Warning about it since last night. It finally started at about ten to one this afternoon, just as I was getting ready to go back to work.

I snapped this shot from my office, through the window, looking out on the parking lot and the entrance to the Music Building. At one point there was enough snow in the air that I could barely make out those trees (not the big pine on the right, the naked ones about a hundred feet out).

My parents, who had been planning to stop in at my place on their way to visit my sister in Calgary, have decided not to come. I think that’s wise.
