# &#8220;Everything that never happened&#8221; update #1

So I’m at 5200 words so far, and here’s the ship that serves as inspiration for the good ship *Mandalay* in the story:

<div align="center">![Nonsuch](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/nonsuch.jpg)</div>It’s called the *Nonsuch*, and it’s in the [Manitoba Museum](http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/mu_nonsuch.html). I’ve been aboard probably a dozen times. IMHO, it’s the coolest exhibit in the museum.

Later!
