# Will wonders never cease?

My world is falling apart. All the supports and structures that make up my worldview are shifting, sliding, collapsing. Listen: *I have found a country album that I may buy*.

Now, to be fair, the band is [Corb Lund and the Hurtin’ Albertans](http://www.corblund.com/). Never heard of ’em? Well, Corb was the bassist for the smalls, back in the day. Never heard of the smalls? Well, I can’t help you, then.

Actually, I can. the smalls were a band out of Alberta, a rock-and-roll indie group, known in the press as “Canada’s Hardest Working Independent Band”. I found them late in their career, at the tail end of a decade plus of touring. They rocked my socks at Minnedosa, and then I caught them in Sassy’s (a former strip joint) for the Brandon show of their “Goodbye Forever” tour. I have two <s>or</s> of their CDs, 1992’s *To Each A Zone* and 1995’s *Waste + Tragedy*, and would love to find their last release, *My Dear Little Angle*.

A few of the tunes on *Waste + Tragedy* are somewhat country-tinged, in content if not in sound. “Pity the Man with the Fast Right Hand”, which I’m listening to *right now*, has lyrics like, for instance,

> Pity the man with the fast right hand  
> In a drunk and a definite way  
> He was a hard, cold fighter with the goods to please the writers  
> Till a woman came to put him away

I mean, what’s more country than *that*? Of course, it comes with a driving bassline owing more to funk than to Waylon Jennings, but the story’s a country ballad, a tragedy of gunsmoke and glove-leather.

So the Corb Lund band, well, it’s not a huge step. Plus I can tell myself it’s “roots” music to make myself feel better about wanting to buy a country album. Which won’t stop my wife from laughing at me. (Well, it hasn’t stopped her so far, anyways.)

Canadians may have seen the video for [The Truck Got Stuck](http://www.corblund.com/audio/hairinmyeyes/02.mp3) on CMT; I know I did, a couple of times. Then CBC played another tune from the same album, [Always Keep an Edge on Your Knife, Son](http://www.corblund.com/audio/hairinmyeyes/03.mp3). So. I think I’m in.

But I’m still not buying Garth Brooks, let me tell you.
