# Party party party

Sunday School party last night (really). Well, sort of. One of the Sunday School teachers (and her family) is buying a house, and so this was the pre-housewarming party. It was an all-ages party, and all the party-goers just slept over at the hosts’ house (it made sense, logistically, since the party was in Chater, which is about 20 minutes out of town. Plus both of us had been drinking, so driving home wasn’t in the cards).
