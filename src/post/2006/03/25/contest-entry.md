# Contest Entry

New short story (less than 1500 words)–[Three Months and Two Days](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/three-months-and-two-days/). I’ll be entering this in the Manitoba Writers’ Collective short fiction contest. If you have any comments, now’s the time; I have to have it postmarked no later than April 3rd.

Oh yeah, you’ll need a password. Highlight to see it –&gt; <span style="color: #fff;font-weight: bold">tommy</span> .

**Later–**The story is in the mail. Here’s the story that I entered a couple years ago, which won me first prize: [A Map to the End of the World](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/map-end-world/).
