# Everything That Never Happened &#8212; problem solved

Apparently my webhost doesn’t like the word c-u-r-l\*. That’s what was hanging me up from posting my new story. But that’s solved, at least worked around, and so: [Everything That Never Happened](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/everything-that-never-happened/). So far it’s ~5400 words spread across one and a half chapters, first draft. Enjoy, if you want to.

\* Presumably because there’s a software package out there called c\_url (without the “\_”) that allows users to snarf entire websites and download them to their local machines. Apparently it’s quite handy for building up massive collections of pornography. Who knew? And here I gave Natasha Noir curly hair.
