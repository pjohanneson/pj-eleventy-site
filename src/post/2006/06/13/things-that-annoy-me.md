# Things that annoy me

<div align="center">![No Left Turn](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/images.jpg)</div>**Attention drivers in my town:** This sign means “No Left Turns”. It applies to you. Yes, even you. If you see this sign, you are not allowed by law to make a left turn.

Not even in the Wal-Mart parking lot.

<div align="center">* * *</div>What right-thinking, rational individual decided that, in the VBScript language, the Boolean value `False` would equate to 0, and `True` would equal -1? I mean really.

Or were there `CInt(False)` right-thinking, rational individuals on the team that created the VBScript specs and code? Hmmm, that would explain quite a lot.
