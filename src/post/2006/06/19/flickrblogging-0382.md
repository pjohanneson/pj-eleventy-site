Discovered in [coisointerrompido](http://www.flickr.com/people/coiso/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>When Diapositios the architect opened his eyes, his jaw dropped open.

“You like it, then,” said Coroloios the builder.

“It’s just like I imagined it,” said Diapositios. “There’s only one little detail you changed, I think.”

“Oh?”

Diapositios turned to Coroloios. “Yes.” He took Coroloios’s collars in his hands and drew him close. “The horse”–his voice rising in volume–“was *supposed*“–and a fire lit his eyes–“*to have **wheels!***“

“For what?” said Coroloios.

Diapositios didn’t reply, just glared into the builder’s eyes from bare inches away.

“–oh. Oh, *now* I get it,” said Coroloios.
