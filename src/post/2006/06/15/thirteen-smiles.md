# Thirteen smiles

Things that make me smile. Reasons to be cheerful, as they say.

1. My darling wife:

This one’s a little image-heavy, so I’ve added the “Continue Reading” link.

3. Loud obnoxious music, to wit: Rob Zombie–“Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)”
4. And the (very) occasional country tune, like this one: Corb Lund and the Hurtin’ Albertans–“The Truck Got Stuck”
5. Judo:

6. Prunes, if they’re done right:

7. Wicked cool bass and wacko lyrics:  
    
  “A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I got a gal who wears her toenails long, drives a red Barracuda singin’ meatpacker songs, and she ain’t from Kalamazoo”  
  Primus–“Kalamazoo”
8. Being silly because I can:
