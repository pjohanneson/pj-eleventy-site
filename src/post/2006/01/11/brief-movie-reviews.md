# Brief movie reviews

<div>In the last week and a half I’ve seen two movies, [Thumbsucker](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318761/combined) and [The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe](http://www.imdb.com//title/tt0363771/). What did I think of them? Well, Thumbsucker was an adolescent-angst movie that proved to me that while Keanu Reeves may not be a brilliant thespian, at least he can act like someone other than Ted Theodore Logan. Also, just because you fill a movie with Big Names doesn’t mean it’s going to be great. The film was solidly OK in my book, though a couple of the characters were full-out unsympathetic and the teenage hero gets toyed with by more than a couple of people. It was a decent film, but I don’t know if I’d watch it again.Narnia was well-done, with some stunning visuals and great acting, especially from the kids that went through the <s>looking-glass</s> wardrobe into the Other World. The animals were all brilliantly done, and ran the gamut from cute and cuddly to regal to downright spooky. The White Witch (played by [Tilda Swinton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842770/), who was also the mother in Thumbsucker) was cold and cruel. There were moments when I could tell that it was based on a childrens’ book, moments where things went a little too easily or took a little too much on faith for my taste, but it was still a good, solid movie. I’d probably watch it again.My friend Kevin has a simple binary scale for movies: It sucked or It didn’t suck. Neither of these two movies sucked, though Thumbsucker had me concerned for a while there. Looking forward now to the new Underworld film. I just hope I’m not expecting too much from it…
