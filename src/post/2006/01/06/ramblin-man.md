# Ramblin&#8217; man

Well, the [Evans](http://www.filmfest.mb.ca/) starts up again soon, so my weekends are getting crowded again. We had coffee with a bunch of the Evans crew tonight, after supper (home-made lasagna–mm mm good).

It’s a little weird. In the summer, when the Evans doesn’t run, I rent movies every week or so, but when the Evans is on, I usually don’t bother. Maybe it’s not so weird, given that I volunteer at the Evans, which means my movies are free…

How many more times will I type Evans before I put this one to bed? About that many, I guess.

G’night. I’m tired and maybe a little stupid.

O wait, one more thing. I had an epiphany tonight, a moment where things in one of my projects suddenly rotated, and a piece I didn’t even know was missing slid into place, and the whole thing, for a moment, shone like silver. Tomorrow, I’ll start outlining; I think I have enough to at least start. I have an ending (which is usually a moving target, but I’ve learned that without an ending, even a tentative one, I shouldn’t write the beginning), and now I think I have a coherent theme. And of course I have a title: *Everything that Never Happened*.

Et maintenant, bonsoir, mes amis et mes amies.
