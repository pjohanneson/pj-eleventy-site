# Plans

So I’m working on a story, called <span style="font-style: italic">Earth Fleet</span> (tentatively), and I want to make <span style="font-style: italic">sure</span> that I do a page\* a day. I have about 40 pages so far, and I want to set up a section on [my site](/) where I can upload the pages as they’re written. Which means I can either (a) find a tool that’ll let me restrict access to the pages, or (b) build one myself. I’m leaning towards (b); I don’t think it’ll be too difficult, and it’s a little specialized to expect to find something pre-built in the OSS\*\* sites on the Internet.

Basically this is a “coming soon” announcement. Once <span style="font-style: italic">Earth Fleet</span> is done, I hope to add other projects.

\* A <span style="font-style: italic">page</span> being defined as one page of 12-point Courier type, single-spaced (I’ll blow it out to double-spaced before printing it for submission, when the novel’s done and done), with one-inch margins all round, or in other words, about 400-450 words.

\*\* Open-Source Software.
