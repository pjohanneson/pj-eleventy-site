# Just for you, Doug&#8230;

…someone’s giving away [free tarantulas](http://www.finkbuilt.com/blog/free-tarantulas/ "Free Hairy Spiders"). Too bad I’m such a wimp, or I might get one myself. If nothing else, it’d sure freak out my mother when she comes to visit…

Note to the squeamish:Â Clicking on the link will cause your browser to show big hairy spiders.
