# Voted.

Yeah. The candidate that usually gets elected ’round these here parts is not who I voted for. I just can’t help hearing that Simpsons bit, where Kang and Kodos are running in the US election, and some guy in the audience says, “Why, I think I’ll just vote for a third-party candidate”, and one of the aliens says, in that delightful booming voice they have, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Go ahead. Throw your vote away.</span>”

I tossed my vote into the æther. And now, because of a new/old law (I think it was struck down by a provincial court before last election, but reinstated before the current one), [I have to wait till 9PM](http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/why10.html) to see any results from anywhere in the country. Weird. Oh well.
