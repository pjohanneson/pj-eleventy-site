# How can you tell it&#8217;s election night?

[CBC.ca](http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/) <s>is</s> was [farked](http://www.fark.com/). **Update**–scant minutes later, I’m getting through. Still.

Apparently I *did* throw my vote away, since [the incumbent](http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/214/) got re-elected. Not that I’m surprised.

Judo–only three of us there, me and a white/yellow striped belt and Darcy, the head instructor. So we didn’t do hane-goshi; instead, Mark–the white/yellow stripe–went through his throws for his yellow belt, and I went over the ones I’ll need to know for my brown belt, and then I did the first three sets of nage-no-kata, which I will also need to know for my brown belt. Then I came home.
