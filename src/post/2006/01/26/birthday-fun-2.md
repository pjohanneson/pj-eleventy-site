# Birthday fun

So my wife’s birthday fell last night. We had a quiet supper at home, then I gave her a couple of books–*It’s a Dog’s Life, Snoopy* and a giant, 30-foot foldout illustrated history of the world. Then we had some friends over for a game of canasta (which the dudes won, after a shaky start) while we drank two and a half bottles of wine and six shots of Blue Bols between us. A good time was had by all.
