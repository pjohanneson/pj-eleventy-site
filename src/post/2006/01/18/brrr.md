# Brrr

Well, it’s colder here today than it has been in a month or more, but at least the Sun was out all day. The temperature was about -11C, which is really not that bad, unless you’ve gotten soft in a winter where the temperature rarely dipped below about -4.

Everything seemed more slippery today, too. I lost my footing about a dozen time, but I didn’t fall, at least.

Mmmm, weather. Is there anything more Canadian to talk about? (Well, I guess there’s the election…)
