# Happy New Year!

<div>Well, I certainly have been slack so far this year. We had a bunch of people over for New Year’s Eve, and then yesterday we went south with Kathleen’s parents for a Sprott New Year’s Day fest.And this year I hope to do at least a page a day of writing, if not more. I have to figure out some way to force myself to keep to a schedule, though. Suggestions?</div>
