# Movie weekend

I saw six movies this weekend…

In chronological order:

*Fantastic Four*–not so fantastic.  
*Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*–enjoyed it about as much as the first time I saw it (which is to say, a fair amount).  
*Water*–Heart-wrenching and very well done.  
*Everything Is Illuminated*–I want to see this again. By turns hilarious and poignant.  
*Underworld Evolution*–Like my friend said, they didn’t do anything new this time out, but the costume was still fantastic.  
*Equilibrium*–It really, *really* wants to be *The Matrix*, but it isn’t quite.

More details on a couple of these later. Right now I’m tired. G’night.
