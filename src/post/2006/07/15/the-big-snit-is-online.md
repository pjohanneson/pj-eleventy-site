# The Big Snit is online

If you haven’t seen it, click [here](http://www.nfb.ca/animation/objanim/en/films/film.php?sort=director&director=Condie%2C+Richard&id=15310) *now*.

Apparently the NFB (that’s the National Film Board, a Canadian organization) has put a mittful of classic short films online, including one of the funniest pieces of animations I’ve ever seen, “[The Big Snit](http://www.nfb.ca/animation/objanim/en/films/film.php?sort=director&director=Condie%2C+Richard&id=15310)” by Richard Condie. Enjoy!
