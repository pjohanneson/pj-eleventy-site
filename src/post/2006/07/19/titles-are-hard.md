# Titles are hard

Or they can be, anyways.

I’m working on expanding and completing the first draft of a story I started in June. It’s set on a slice of a Dyson shell made of trees woven into each others’ root systems, wrapped around a star and sent on its way into the intergalactic dark. No one alive knows where they’re going, or why the world’s makers (the Forgotten Gods) sent them in the first place.

I’ve been calling it “Wisdom Finds Me”, because that’s what the main character’s name means in the local forest tongue, but I want something more… something more. Tonight I came up with “Can’t See the Forest for the Stars”, and I kind of like it, but I’m not entirely sure.

Any suggestions?
