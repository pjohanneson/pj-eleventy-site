<div style="text-align: center;">[![Editing](http://static.flickr.com/35/119996518_0055bac917_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/119996518/ "Photo Sharing")</div>One-sentence synopses for projects I’m working on.

1. **Earth Fleet**  
  A mysteriously empty Earth serves as backdrop and catalyst to a final, apocalyptic battle between two warring human civilizations.
2. **The Coldest War**  
  An army of ghosts, resurrected in the outer solar system, battles against incursions from the living in the inner system and a swarm of alien ghosts from interstellar space.
3. **The Trees**  
  On a Dyson shell traveling through the intergalactic dark, a young boy may be the descendant of the godlike people who launched the shell, or merely the pawn of two factions involved in a protracted cold war.
4. **Everything That Never Happened**  
  The captain of a ketch is forced to work for zombies, but the treasure they seek may spell the end of life as he has known it.
5. **Salyx**  
  A young boy comes of age on a distant colony world, just as Earth is attempting to reconnect with all the worlds it has lost touch with.
6. **The Parley**  
  The human race meets one last time on Earth to hammer out a universal truce, but a murder takes center stage.
7. **Esau**  
  A cyborg gunslinger makes his way to the capital of the kingdom, to kill his brother, the king.
8. **Heaven and Earth**  
  A man, enslaved by the woman that killed and resurrected him, plots vengeance, but she is more dangerous that he knows.
9. **The Ash of Memory**  
  A woman passes through the bardo, purifying herself and preparing for her reincarnation.
10. **Fimbulvetr**  
  The last man in a snow-covered world meets with characters out of Norse myth.
11. **Yasht**  
  A Universe-spanning hive mind that may or may not be God makes contact with the human race.
12. **Across a Wounded Land**  
  A man teams up with a cyborg to rescue his wife from a wizard, but the cyborg has plans of his own.
13. **Heat Death**  
  After the stars go out, the gods gather to discuss what comes next.
