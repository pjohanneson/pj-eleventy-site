# Wind

Last night a ferocious wind went through town.

There wasn’t any rain (not much, anyways), but the wind got up to probably about 100 km/h (~60 mph), and did a fair amount of damage. One co-worker said that he’d seen a truck crushed under a tree on his way to work. My place got off fairly light.

This isn’t my fence. Fortunately.

A couple shots of the tree branch that snapped in my front yard.
