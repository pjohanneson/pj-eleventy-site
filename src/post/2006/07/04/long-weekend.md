Highlights: Pool party with the Sunday School teachers and their families. Putting siding on my parents’ house. Going to possibly the most beautiful place in Manitoba. Visiting with my sister, her hubby, and their boys. Putting more siding on my parents’ house. Visiting with my sister, her hubby, and their boys.

Photos were taken and will be posted probably tomorrow. Right now I’m a little tired.
