# The Hotel

Discovered in [colinedwards99](http://www.flickr.com/people/colinedwards/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>…and to cap off your evening, what could be better than a romantic night at The Hexagon, the only four-star hotel in the Western Wastes? The hotel is patterned after the distinctive shape of a snowflake, and fenced with a Wampa-proof perimeter defence system, and our ever-changing entertainment and dining menus will offer you a distinctive stay every time.

Once again, let me thank you for considering Hoth as your vacation destination.
