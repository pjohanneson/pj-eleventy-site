# Some quick reviews

It’s been a busy few days.

Thursday: we went to [**Superman Returns**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/). The movie was okay, but I think it could have been a lot more fun. Superman was dull and flat, and Lois was just depressed. Fortunately, Lex Luthor was a show-stealer, and provided most of the laughs (though there were moments where Jimmy Olsen’s imperturbably positive worldview made me think of Will Ferrell, in a good way).

Friday: I bought [*Clone Wars Vol I and II*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361243/) and Mike Patton’s latest project, *Peeping Tom*.

*Peeping Tom* is an eclectic mix of tunes. Mike Patton (lead singer for the now-defunct [Faith No More](http://www.fnm.com/), among other things) teams up with a bunch of different people. Apparently the sound files were transferred via email between the various participants during the album’s gestation period. I enjoy the tunes; somewhere online I read that the project is “pop music as Mike Patton would like to define pop music”.

Given that Patton’s voice is one of the reasons that I liked Faith No More so much–he’s got a range from guttural, death-metal low registers, all the way up to a nasal falsetto, and he sounds particularly nasty when he’s stage-whispering–it seems natural that I would like this album. And I do.

**Interesting note:** One of his co-conspirators is [Norah Jones](http://www.norahjones.com/home.htm). And she swears.

<s>Peeping Tom on Conan O’Brien, performing “Mojo”, the album’s first single</s> **Taken off of YouTube due to copyright violations.**

We also rented [Kiss Kiss Bang Bang](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373469/), which was a fun, violent, swear-filled romp. It was a lot of fun to watch, sort of in the Pulp Fiction vein (in more ways than one, really).

And tonight I watched Volume II of Clone Wars (I’d already seen Volume I at my sister’s place, courtesy of my bro-in-law). Volume II was just as well-done as Volume I. Why o why couldn’t the prequel trilogy have been this good?

One of the extras on the DVD was a short film called [Revenge of the Brick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9iwYDBKw88). It’s brilliant. Especially the orchestral bit at the end. Enjoy!

Oh, one more sort-of *Star Wars* related item. A cow-orker forwarded this to me, and now I’m contemplating buying the album. It’s a song called “Crazy”, by a band called Gnarls Barkley.
