# 2 stories

I’ve sent “Outside, Looking In” to a magazine, and I’ll be sending “Heat Death” to another one once their reading period opens up (May 1st, so, really, tomorrow). I had some encouraging words this weekend from a friend who read “Heat Death” at the tail end of a party, and proceeded to gush about my writing talent as he read it. He was a little drunk, but hey, *in vino veritas*, no?

Wish me luck!
