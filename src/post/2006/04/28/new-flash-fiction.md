# New flash fiction

So I picked up a short story I’d started in December, found an ending for it, and put it all together in less than 1,000 words. It’s called “Heat Death” and I think I’m going to submit it. If you’re interested (it’s short–989 words by the counter in OpenOffice, 982 by the counter on [the BBS](http://www.writersbbs.com/)), drop me a line.
