# Today&#8230;

…I saw a pair of horse-drawn carriages coming down the street. They pulled off, into a parking lot, to let the traffic behind them go by. Inspired by [Rob Cockerham’s](http://www.cockeyed.com/) motto (“Always bring your camera”), I snapped a couple of photos, presented below for your edification. No, I don’t know where the carriages were going. Yes, the drivers had cowboy hats on.

Tonight we are going to the “[Outside the Perimeter](http://www.winnipegcomedyfestival.com/shows_detail.php?sid=66)“\* show of the CBC’s [Winnipeg Comedy Festival](http://www.winnipegcomedyfestival.com/). I’m quite looking forward to it.
