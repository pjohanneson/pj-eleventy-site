# Research

So I’m going to have to put my current project on the back burner for the time being. I need to do a lot more research, it looks like, before I set a story aboard a 17th-century ketch. What with being a child of the landlocked prairie, growing up in the late 20th-early 21st centuries, who’d’a thunk it?

But that’s okay. It’ll give me a chance to return to a couple of science fiction projects, *Earth Fleet* and *Salyx* (this last being my [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) project for 2005).

Off to write!
