# So glad I found it

So I went to the judo club today, for a two-hour review of my blue belt and brown belt throws (at some point I’ll be grading for my brown belt; I’m not sure if it’ll be this spring or next fall), and then after that I went and did some shopping. I bought a short-sleeve white dress shirt, which I’ll need for refereeing in judo (refs wear black socks, charcoal-grey pants, a white shirt, navy tie, and a navy sportcoat–very natty), and then I ducked into a music store. Cruised the aisles, not looking for anything in particular, just… looking. Browsing.

![13 Engines -- Perpetual Motion Machine](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/14104.jpg)In the used CDs section, my eyes lit upon it: [13 Engines](http://www.answers.com/topic/13-engines)‘ *[Perpetual Motion Machine](http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsid=2360&dekey=R+++196658&curtab=2360_1)[](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/2006/04/09/so-glad-i-found-it/13-engines-perpetual-motion-machine/ "13 Engines -- Perpetual Motion Machine")*. I had the tape (I still do, somewhere, though I’d be hard pressed to find it), and it’s one of the very few albums where I like *every single song*. There are the straight-ahead rockers, like “Bred in the Bone” and “Smoke and Ashes”, and there are a fair number of moody, slower numbers, like “Moment of Clarity” and one of my favourites, “The Golden Age”:

> So the Golden Age passed away to Silver  
> But that was long ago  
> There were swimming holes and the Vaudeville  
> They gave way to this  
> Bronze turned itself slowly into iron  
> And here we are today
> 
> If what you say has the grain of truth  
> The Age of Rust is soon…

The instruments are just the way I like ’em–the bass is a central part of the music, not just a background rhythm engine, and the guitar is well-played. They can do the fuzz-out wall of sound just as well as the soft melancholy sway of a down-tempo tune.

(Aside: “The Golden Age” just started playing on my CD changer’s *Random*. Good timing!)

Fourteen tunes, and not a one of them a miss.

Oh, and because it was in the second-hand shelf, and probably had been there a while (it’s an album from 1993), the price was right: $4.99 plus taxes.

Ah, smiley times…
