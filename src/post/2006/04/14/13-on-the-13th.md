Thirteen Things about **Patrick Johanneson**

1. Primus, “Tommy the Cat”, from the soundtrack to *Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey*.  
  This song introduced me to Primus, the bass-centred wacko-lyrics band from El Sobrante, and I’ve never had cause to look back since. It’s the story of a female cat out lookin’ for some action. When she finds Tommy the Cat, her search is over:  
  > The air was filled with catcalls (no pun intended) but not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered straight into the heart of the alleyway. She knew what she wanted. She was lookin’ for the stud-bull; the he-cat. Well that was me.
  > 
  > Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee:
  > 
  > Say baby do you wanna lay down with me  
  > Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side  
  > Say baby do you wanna lay down with me  
  > Say baby, say baby
  
  The video for the song features Les Claypool, the manic madman on bass and vocals, as a Roarin’ 20s-style bartender in a milk bar. It must be seen to be believed.
2. The Lügen Brothers, “Son of a Bitch to the Core”, from the soundtrack to *Hard Core Logo*.  
  *HCL* was a mockumentary, a film about the reunion tour of a fictional punk band. The lead singer, Joe Dick (IIRC), was played by Headstones frontman Hugh Dillon. Great show, and the soundtrack plays right into the whole mythos by virtue of being set up as a tribute album to the fictional band (also named Hard Core Logo). There are two version on the soundtrack of “Son of a Bitch to the Core”, both of them great–hey, it’s a great tune. The Headstones do a straight-up rocker, and the Lügen Brothers do it as a country-styled barn-burner. I love both versions, I do, but oddly enough, I have to give the country version the nod here. There’s a subtle difference in the two songs:
  
  > **Headstones:** …If you take me on, I’m gonna lose / it’s a son of a bitch to the core…  
  > **Lügen Bros:** …If you take me on, you’re gonna lose / ’cause I’m a son of a bitch to the core…
3. Bad Religion, “Leaders and Followers”, on the *Clerks* soundtrack. Punk the way punk should be; not watered-down “poor whiney me” but fast and loud and short and relevant. Plus they use big words to good effect.  
  > There’s the image of a man who commands a high opinion  
  > While he hides his hatred with a sheepish grin  
  > And beside him, flanking closely, are the voiceless hollow masses  
  > Who lap up whatever trickles in
  > 
  > This intercourse of nature, this vulgar social pasttime  
  > Reflects the lowest mark of our progress  
  > And the few who ride peripheral maintain subtle advantage  
  > Fighting hard to abstain and redress
4. Barry Adamson’s “Something Wicked This Way Comes” on the *Lost Highway* soundtrack. It’s an instrumental, and it’s moody and spooky, and it’s just the right pick for the scene in the movie where the creepy little old guy accosts Fred, telling him “I’m at your house *right now*. Phone me.”
5. John Williams’ “Imperial March”, from *The Empire Strikes Back*. (Is it running through your head now? Because it’s sure running through *mine*…)
6. And its antithesis, the cheerful, chirpy “Cantina Band song” from *Star Wars*.
7. “Belleville Rendez-vous” from *Les Triplette de Bellevile*. It’s not quite “found sound”, since the sisters brought all the items with them to the show, but I never would’ve guessed you could find music in the fanning of newspaper pages, the wheeze of an old vacuum cleaner, and the tickety-tick-ticking of a bicycle tire.
8. “Green Onions”, from the *Get Shorty* soundtrack. Just ‘cuz.
9. Rufus Wainwright’s version of “Hallelujah” on the *Shrek* soundtrack. Haunting and dark in a way that most of the other tunes weren’t.
10. Gord Downie’s solo, a capella version of “Hallelujah” on the *Saint Ralph* soundtrack. (Is it cheating to include the same song twice? Do I even care?)
11. Despite my general dislike of country music, I have to include “Man of Constant Sorrow” by the Soggy Bottom Boys on the *O Brother, Where Art Thou?* soundtrack.
12. And the sirens, singing “Didn’t Leave Nobody but the Baby”, on the *O Brother* soundtrack, too.
13. And finally, from *Trainspotting*, I have to go with “Perfect Day”, with its creepy, somewhat random spouting of James Bond movie titles.
