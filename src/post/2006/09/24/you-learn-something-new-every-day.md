# You learn something new every day

So we have this little time-waster computer game that is a bit like Boggle, in that you have to create words from a clustered bunch of letters. I was playing it, and in a desperation move I spelled the word ZARF.

And it took it.

Hmmm, says I. So I ended the game and went to that great agglomeration of knowledge, the internet.

Whattayaknow, [it is a word](http://www.answers.com/topic/zarf), and what’s more, I’ve used one and never known what it’s called.
