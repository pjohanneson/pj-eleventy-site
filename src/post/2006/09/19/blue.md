# Blue

*^^^That ain’t me.*</div>My new *judogi* came in tonight. It’s very blue.

Also: I’ve become hopelessly addicted to the new *[Battlestar Galactica](http://www.spacecast.com/bsg/)* series. A co-worker (thanks, John!) loaned me the first couple DVDs the other day, and I watched them; now I’ve got the next three discs. Must… pace… myself.

It was amusing, though, to show the movie [A Simple Curve](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0422458/) at the [Evans](http://www.filmfest.mb.ca/) this past weekend. It’s a good film; I enjoyed it more than I expected to. But the funny part? Seeing Michael Hogan (BSG’s uptight, angry Colonel Tigh) play Jim, an aging but still-immature hippie.

Doug, here’s my favorite line from the movie, paraphrased from memory:

\[discussing a moment in Jim’s past sex life\]  
**Caleb**: Oh God, it was a hippie *threesome*?  
**Jim**: No. No, no, no. \[pauses\] We, uh, we took turns.

Tonight: some more writing, and then I think it’ll be bedtime.
