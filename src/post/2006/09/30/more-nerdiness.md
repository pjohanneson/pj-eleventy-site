# More nerdiness&#8230;

…if you’ll permit me.

[Code Igniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/) rocks\*.

It was a geeky night for me. I watched an episode of *Battlestar Galactica*, then fiddled with Code Igniter for an hour that felt like ten minutes. I think I’m going to try and use CI for a website that will allow me to give friends and family the ability to read and comment on my fiction, without throwing it open for the whole of the internet to read.

I guess the next step is to plan out the database structure, and then write some more CI code. And write some more fiction, too, of course…
