# Things I did today

Haircut today. Then judo. Both went well.

Now I’m going to do some writing. Here’s a sample from my current project, *Salyx*:

> There was an upright piano, a slab of black lacquered wood and polished brass, stationed in the center of a navy-blue disc of rug woven with a fine filigree of white lines. The piano had the look of a factory job, a templated, nano-shit reproduction, but it was the rug that drew Igraine’s eye. She stood for a long moment, squinting at the patterns, till with a start she realized what was so familiar about them: they were control-system hierarchy maps copied from one of the manuals for the *Tern*s, their lines distorted by the fact that they were wound around themselves in a spiral that converged on the rug’s center, hidden beneath the edges of the piano. She smiled and took a sip of the green-apple wine that William had scared up for her.  
> Kane, speaking from just over her left shoulder, said, “You noticed.”
> 
> She laughed. “You surprised me,” she said.
> 
> Kane stepped from behind her. “My wife wove it,” he said. “She had a big loom, and I had about a dozen of the old books…”
> 
> Something in his voice when he spoke of his wife told Igraine that she was dead now, Kane a widower, and she lowered her eyes for a second. “Musuf would’ve liked it,” she said.
> 
> “Musuf?”
> 
> “He was my husband,” she said.
> 
> “Ah,” said Kane, “I think I remember him. Tall man, smiled a lot?”
> 
> “That’s the one,” said Igraine, her voice absent, her thoughts lost in the whorls of the rug. Musuf had been a control expert. This was his kind of thing.
> 
> Someone sat down at the piano and began to play “Rags to Riches”. Igraine finished off her wine and said, “I need a refill, if we’re going to talk about the past.”
