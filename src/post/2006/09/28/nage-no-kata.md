# Nage no Kata

So next Wednesday (October 4th), I will be grading for my brown belt in judo. This will put me one step away from my shodan, or black belt.

I’ll have to do an abbreviated set of the nage-no-kata (the forms of throwing), as demonstrated below:

(The part that I have to do ends at the four-minute mark.)

Plus I’ll have to be able to demonstrate a random selection from the [gokyo-no-waza](http://www.judoinfo.com/gokyo1.htm), or the forty throws, plus a variety of [hold-downs](http://www.judoinfo.com/pinning.htm), [arm-locking](http://www.judoinfo.com/kansetsuwaza.htm) techniques, and [strangles](http://www.judoinfo.com/shime.htm).

Looking forward to it!
