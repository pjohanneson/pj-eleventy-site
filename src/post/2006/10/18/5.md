# 5

**List five truths. Five things that are on your mind. Good, bad, it matters not. Lift some weight off.**

1. Sometimes hanging out with friends is more important than a good night’s sleep.
2. [Just](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/004457.html) [about](http://users.wolfcrews.com/toys/vikings/) [anything](http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/topics/dumbledore.html) [can](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg4PY_lsw_k) [be](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fyXm_9D7s8) [found](http://qntm.org/destroy) [on](http://www.cuteoverload.com/) [the](http://knuttz.net/hosted_pages/VW-Beetles-20061017) [internet](http://www.dieselsweeties.com/shirts/chewieismycopilot/).
3. There’s always someone who knows more than you. Learn from him, her, or it.
4. Being cold sucks worse than getting “toque hair”.
5. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
6. **Later:** I realized I forgot a most important truth: “The truth, Binkley, is that you look like a carrot.”

**Then pick five people to do the same.**  
Craig. Doug. Gabriele. Clark. And you, whoever you are.
