# More writing

More from *Salyx*:

> Sometimes Igraine would have to go down the axis to the ship’s engine room, where the walking dead worked, men and women so riddled with cancer that they didn’t bother to pretend anymore that they’d survive. They had a ghastly humor down there, a gallows humor, and one of them had set up a spherical force-field and filled it with water, just to see it glow with blue Cerenkov radiation. Igraine hated having to go to the engine room, hated seeing the thin, crowlike engineers, sprouting dark tumors and coughing out blood and teeth, raining hair. She’d go in, hand them the flow corrections she’d calculated, and flee, hating herself for her fear.
