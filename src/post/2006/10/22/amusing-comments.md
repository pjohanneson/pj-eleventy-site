# Amusing comments

I like finding that people who write code have a sense of humour:

> This lets you specify which characters are permitted within your URLs. When someone tries to submit a URL with disallowed characters they will get a warning message.
> 
> As a security measure you are STRONGLY encouraged to restrict URLs to as few characters as possible. By default only these are allowed: a-z 0-9~%.:\_-
> 
> Leave blank to allow all characters â€” but only if you are insane.

Well, it made *me* laugh.
