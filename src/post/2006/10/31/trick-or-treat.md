# Trick or treat

[Hollow Bean](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/2005/10/31/explain-said-the-interrogation-machine/) approaches once again, and this year there’s a cute li’l Jack-o-lantern in my window to greet the hordes of children that come to ring my bell and get loot.

<div align="center">[![Ready for Hallowe'enies](http://static.flickr.com/116/284088332_8ba9c5f1f2_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/284088332)</div>See? Ain’t he cute? And look, the picture’s full of “mysterious orbs”, too. Must be a flock of ghosts, visiting each other, getting into the Hollow Bean spirit.

Or maybe it’s just the snow that was falling all day long.

Have a happy and safe Hollow Bean, everyone.
