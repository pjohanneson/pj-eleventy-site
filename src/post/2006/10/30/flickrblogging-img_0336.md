<div align="center">[![](http://static.flickr.com/48/163742608_fbab37f64c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/katylillich/163742608/ "IMG_0336 from flickr.com")  
[IMG\_0336](http://www.flickr.com/photos/katylillich/163742608/)  
Discovered in [ktk8](http://www.flickr.com/people/katylillich/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>Granted, the garden didn’t produce much in the way of fruit, but at least I didn’t have to weed all that often.
