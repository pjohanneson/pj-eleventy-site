# Flickrblogging &#8212; 9684

<div align="center">[![](http://static.flickr.com/33/63463666_70672bea14_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carolynhack/63463666/ "IMG_9684 from flickr.com")

Discovered in [carolynhack](http://www.flickr.com/people/carolynhack/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>Ladies, Gentlemen, I present to you the cover art for my newest how-to guide, “Making a Cyborg on $6 a day”. This one is an illustration from the “Optical ‘Enhancement'” section. You’ll note the quote marks around the word “Enhancement”; my lawyers, God bless their black little souls, suggested that, in the interest of avoiding lawsuits, I use little so-called “irony quotes” around certain terms.

Please note also that there is a substantial addendum to the book, and that the major update to the “Optical ‘Enhancement'” section points out that, due to the $6 nature of the “Infrared” Eye “Augmentation” “Device”, you can’t actually set fires with your new-found “heat” vision. Or perhaps that should be “vision”.
