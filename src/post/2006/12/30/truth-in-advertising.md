# &#8220;Truth&#8221; in advertising

Last night I saw an ad for *Eragon*, which ran a bit like this:

> “The critics are in agreement! \[praise for *Eragon*\]! \[praise for *Eragon*\]! Now playing!”

I couldn’t help but notice that they had all of two quotes praising the film, so I decided I’d do my own research. I went to that clearinghouse of critical opinion, rottentomatoes.com. Regarding *Eragon*: The film had a 12% rating. (Hmmm. Overnight it’s [climbed to 13%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eragon/).) This means that 13% of the critics weighing in on the film had a high opinion of the movie, and 87%, well, didn’t.

The critics *are* in agreement, but I don’t think that’s the kind of message that puts buttocks in theatre seats.
