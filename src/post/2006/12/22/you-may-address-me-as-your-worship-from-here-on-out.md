# You may address me as &#8220;Your Worship&#8221; from here on out&#8230;

…since, thanks to [Doug](http://ballsandwalnuts.com/?p=1564), I now know that my [Peculiar Aristocratic Name](http://www.masquerademaskarts.com/memes/peculiartitle.php) is **Bishop Lord Patrick the Glutinous: of Heffton St Mallet**. Note that’s “Glutinous”, like “Pillsbury Dough-boy”, as opposed to “Gluttonous”, as in “Henry VIII”. Not sure that it’s really any better, mind you, just *different*.

End communication.
