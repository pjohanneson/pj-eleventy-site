# 968 words so far&#8230;

…in “Andy’s Party”, which is (probably) going to be my Kitchen Fiction entry.

Excerpt:

<div>Gerald and Phil ran into Dean and Carleen at the liquor mart. The party was BYOB, and so they were trying to decide between brands of vodka. Carleen was a bit of a conoisseur, and so was trying to steer Dean toward the expensive stuff. Dean was looking at the cheap stuff, the economy being what it was and all. Gerald said, “I read somewhere”–which with Gerald usually translated to *I saw on the Internet*–“that you can filter the cheap stuff through a water filter, like say a Brita? About four times, and it tastes just as good as the expensive stuff.” Dean gave Carleen a look, and Carleen said, “You’re not helping, Gerry.” Which was true, and at least partly why he’d said it in the first place.

“So if you were wanting beer”–Carleen made a face–“what kind would you like?”

“Horse piss,” said Carleen, not quite *sotto voce*. An older man on the other side of the vodka aisle gave her a distasteful look, and she winked at him. Flustered, he looked away.

“Uh, Rickard’s is always good,” said Dean. “Canadian’s not bad either.”

“If you can stand the taste,” said Carleen.

“You’ve already made it clear you’re not drinking it,” said Phil. To Dean: “What about Blue?”

“Yeah, sure, whatever,” said Dean. “Beer’s beer, you know?”

They all four of them nodded.

</div>Sound Manitoban? Prairie? Canadian? Hope so; that’s what I’m goin’ for.
