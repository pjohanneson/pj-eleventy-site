# up to 2900 words now

Another excerpt from “Andy’s Party”:

<div>Sherritt came in next, and while he was setting his six-pack of O’Meara down in the kitchen, Nia and her sister Jessa were ringing the bell. The pair of them were a study in opposites, Nia tall and dark-haired, her eyes a liquid, expressive brown, and Jessa small and blonde, with blue eyes that shone with a flat light, masking whatever went on within. Sherritt, ever the gentleman, carried the ladies’ coats down to the bedroom, and met up with them again in the kitchen.

“What you drinking, Coke?” said Jessa as he poured from the bottle into one of Phil’s drinking jars.

“No,” he said, “stout.” And had to explain what stout was, and give her a sip from his glass, at which she made a crinkly face and said, “Well, I won’t be stealing your beer tonight.”

“More for me,” he said.

“You got that right.”
