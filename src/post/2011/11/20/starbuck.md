# Starbuck

If you have the chance, check out the movie [*Starbuck*](http://evanstheatre.ca/movies/starbuck/ "Starbuck at the Evans"). I just got home from showing it at the [Evans Theatre](http://evanstheatre.ca/), and I must say, I really enjoyed it. It’s funny, it’s touching, and it shows — yet again — that Canada can make great movies.

It’s the story of David, a forty-something who I would describe as a lovable loser. He’s drifting through life, working at a butcher shop, playing soccer, getting into debt. He discovers that, due to some shenanigans at the sperm bank where he used to donate, he’s the father of 500+ children. Over a hundred of those kids — now in their late teens/early twenties — have banded together in a class-action lawsuit to find out the identity of their real father, known to them only as his sperm-bank codename: Starbuck.

What comes next? You’ll have to check out the movie to find out. Trust me. It’s worth it.
