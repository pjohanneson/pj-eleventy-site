# Well that&#8217;s convenient

So I’ve been taking a course on “The Art of Managing Your Career”. It’s a look at the business side of an arts career, and since I’d love, someday, to make a living (or at least part of my living) as a writer, it’s right up my alley.

Today we were discussing websites, among other things. So I said, “Hey, since you’re looking for sites to review, here’s mine.”

I thought it rather convenient that the random picture chooser script I’ve got on [my homepage](/) selected this photo to show to the group:

Ah, random numbers. How I love thee.
