# My weekend

I traveled to Edmonton for a judo tournament, I got to see some relatives, and I drove all the way back in a five-speed car with armstrong steering and no radio. It was a good time, but Iâ€™m glad to be home now.

More details later. For now, enjoy the video of me getting thrown around.
