# Lately

What I’ve been up to lately:

**Judo**

Learning some Kodokan goshin-jutsu.

**Writing**

Not as much as I’d like, sadly, though I did go to the [Tunnels of Moose Jaw](http://www.tunnelsofmoosejaw.com/) on a research trip.

**Work**

Just waiting for the faculty to all show up again. After all, it’s the end of summer.
