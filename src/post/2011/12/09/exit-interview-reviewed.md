# &#8220;Exit Interview&#8221; reviewed

A website called [Diabolical Plots](http://www.diabolicalplots.com/ "Diabolical Plots") has taken it upon themselves to review pretty much anything and everything that [Daily Science Fiction](http://dailysciencefiction.com/) publishes. In the last week or so, they got to the August 2011 stories, which include my short story, “[Exit Interview](http://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/aliens/patrick-johanneson/exit-interview)“.

In short: they liked it.

> When I was asked to review “**Exit Interview”** by **Patrick Johanneson** (debut 8/3 and reviewed by Anonymous), I was pleased as I clearly remembered reading it the day it arrived in my inbox–always a good sign. I enjoyed it as much reading it a second time.

They also pointed out that no less a luminary than Mike Resnick — *Mike Resnick!* — has sold a story to Daily SF. That’s some esteemed company to be in, methinks. (For those not in the know — Mike Resnick has been nominated for more Hugo Awards than any other science fiction writer. Including Grandmasters like Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein.)

So. How’s *your* day been?
