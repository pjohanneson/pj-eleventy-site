# The Evans Theatre

Part of the “webmonkey” side of my profile: I’ve been monkeying with the Evans Theatre’s website, trying to make it look purty and be useful. I’d like to think I’m close.

Have a look: [Evans Theatre’s new site](http://evanstheatre.ca/)

&lt;nerd&gt;It’s a hand-coded [WordPress ](http://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress")theme using [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fluid-images/) concepts. Check it out at various browser widths — the images should (mostly) scale nicely. If you’ve got an iPhone or some other pocket browser, I’d love to hear comments.&lt;/nerd&gt;

So? Is it purty, or what?
