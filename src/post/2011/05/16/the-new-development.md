# The new development

I went for a bike ride last night. I did about 17km in just under an hour and a half. I don’t know if that’s a slow pace or a middlin’ one; I wasn’t completely spent at the end of it, but I *was* sweating throughout.

At about the midpoint of the ride, I came across an area of new development:

Which is all well and good, but I found the choice of location rather interesting. Here’s the view across the bike path:

Here I though that luxury condos with a view of the Superstore parking lot would be a tough sell.
