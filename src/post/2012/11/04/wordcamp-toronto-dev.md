# WordCamp Toronto Dev

Yesterday I learned about IDEs, debugging, geolocation, rapid deployment with Capistrano, remote control, all the things I’m doing wrong on WordPress and how to fix them, and that I apparently talk faster when I’m nervous. On today’s agenda: mobile sites, structured data, and other goodies.
