# The open-web-o-phile&#8217;s lament

My co-worker Craig pointed me at this: [The Web We Lost](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html "Depressing"), by Anil Dash.

That reminds me â€” I have a crazy backlog of posts I need to write (WCTO, book review, &amp;c). Also I need to post more photos to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj).
