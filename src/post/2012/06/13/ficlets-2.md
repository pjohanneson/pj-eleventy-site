# Ficlets

Some of my short fiction — all the stuff I posted on [Ficlets](http://ficlets.ficly.com/authors/pj) (RIP), for instance — is licensed with a rather permissive [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) [Attribution-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) license. This means that when it turns up on a site like [Compumatrix](http://compumatrix.us/blog/view_/search-id_f5e3c23782c50fc86922b53f53871a1a/), I can’t request that it be taken down.

Not that this bothers me, really. My words are being read, and sometimes in places I’d never expect. Maybe it torques me a little that someone’s “monetized” my works, but I have the feeling that the money involved is pretty small. (I don’t know; maybe “Wilma(logima)” is rolling in long green thanks to me. I doubt I’ll ever know for sure. I also doubt I’ll lose sleep over it.)

Most of the ficlets that I wrote were dashed off in fifteen minutes; sometimes the hardest part was trimming them down to fit the site’s 1024-character maximum. I’m glad people still find them so fascinating.

I’m sure it’s popped up other places, some of which I’ll eventually stumble upon. Like I said, the Ficlets are licensed permissively, and I have no intentions of trying to get any of them taken down. (I’ll do what I can to make sure they’re properly attributed, of course.) I’m just glad people are enjoying my fiction.

Speaking of which: [There’s more fiction over here](/fiction/ "My fiction"), if you’re interested. (The bulk of which, please note, is *not* CC-licensed.)
