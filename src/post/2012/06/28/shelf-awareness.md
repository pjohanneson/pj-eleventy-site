# Shelf Awareness&#8217; Q&#038;A

**On your nightstand right now:**

*Fictions* by Jorge Luis Borges, thanks to an essay in William Gibson’s *Distrust that Particular Flavor*.

**Favorite book when you were a child:**

Strangely, it was probably *The Forever War* by Joe Haldeman. I grew up in a house where my father’s science fiction novels dominated every bookshelf — and there were a lot of bookshelves. I didn’t understand a tenth of what was really going on in the book, but I read it over and over all the same.

**Your top five authors:**

In no particular order, Michael Swanwick, William Gibson, Joe Haldeman, Elmore Leonard, and Terry Pratchett. I like literate SF/F, I like quick, clean prose, and I like to laugh.

**Book you’re an evangelist for:**

*Stations of the Tide*, by Michael Swanwick. It’s the tale of a bureaucrat tasked with chasing down a magician who is spreading proscribed technology on a world about to be consumed by a great flood, and it’s based on Shakespeare’s *The Tempest*. It also features tantric sex lessons from a witch.

**Book you’ve faked reading:**

Hmmm. I never managed to finish *The Da Vinci Code*; I went to see the movie just to see if I had missed anything. (Nope.)

**Book you’ve bought for the cover:**

*Freaky Deaky* by Elmore Leonard. It was the first novel of his that I read. I was hooked by the end of the first scene.

**Favorite line from a book:**

“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” — *The Gunslinger*, by Stephen King. Coming in at a very close second: “We realize this means the destruction of solar systems, but consider the alternative.” — *A Fire Upon the Deep*, by Vernor Vinge. And: “The bureaucrat fell from the sky.” — *Stations of the Tide*, by Michael Swanwick

**Book you most want to read again for the first time:**

The entirety of Stephen King’s *Dark Tower* saga.
