# Thunderstorm for May Day

[![Some very bright lightning](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7189/6988411984_65828d9939.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/6988411984/ "Some very bright lightning by Patrick Johanneson, on Flickr")

I got to use my cameraâ€™s CHDK software to snag some photos of lightning. This one was by far the best and the brightest of the images.
