# May Long Weekend, 2012

Here’s where I spent my weekend:

The MasterCard Centre in Etobicoke, Ontario, site of the Ontario Open judo tournament. I was there as a freshly-minted National C referee. The judo was fast, the venue was chilly — that concrete holds a deep chill — and the people were great.

My wife asked me if I’d go again. Yes. Yes I would.
