# &#8220;Japan&#8217;s first robot buddy cop movie&#8221;

There’s a phrase that makes me perk right up and pay attention. I found this on the Internet, thanks to Wil Wheaton, and it struck me that whether or not it’s true, the story is awesome.

And I quote:

> Japan’s first robot buddy cop movie, a silent film released in 1919, was shown only once, to an assembly of wealthy land owners in Tokyo. When the film ended, the audience demand for affordable giant robots to work their fields and control the peasants was so insistent, emperor Hirohito had the only copy of the film impounded and destroyed to prevent the idea from capturing the public’s imagination.

Found via [Wil Wheaton’s tumblr](http://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/19352664459/japans-first-robot-buddy-cop-movie-a-silent-film). Go ahead, click through. There’s a great photo and everything.
