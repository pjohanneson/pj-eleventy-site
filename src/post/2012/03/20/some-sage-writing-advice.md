# Some sage writing advice

…from none other than Neil Gaiman.

> You being lazy and unmotivated and not writing allows another writer, who does sit down and write, to get published in your place. Magazines and publishers only have so many pages, so many annual publishing spots. You’re letting someone else who wants to do the work get published.

So very true. Write *faster*, Johanneson.
