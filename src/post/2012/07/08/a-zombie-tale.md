# A Zombie Tale

I saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/innsmouthpress/status/221308548498460672) from [Innsmouth Press](http://www.innsmouthfreepress.com/) — purveyors, IIRC, of latter-day Cthulhu stories and the like — that spoke of a new anthology of Canadian zombie fiction, to be titled [Dead North](http://silviamoreno-garcia.com/blog/dead-north-guidelines/). I thought *Hmmm, that could be an interesting challenge.*

So I’m currently ruminating on a short story about local zombies. So far I’m thinking about zombies in government, running the show, and a small enclave of people struggling to cure what they perceive as the zombie curse. Once I’ve got a draft, I’ll be looking for people to read it and offer critique. Let me know in the comments if you’d be interested in helping out.
