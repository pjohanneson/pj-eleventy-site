# Aurora Borealis, July 14/15, 2012

[![Aurora Borealis](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8168/7582317846_a0b7fcecc6.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/7582317846/ "Aurora Borealis by Patrick Johanneson, on Flickr")

I set my camera up outside at my in-lawsâ€™ farm, and set it to take 15-second exposures all night. I was hoping to catch some Northern Lights, since the sun fired off a coronal mass ejection on the 12th.

Thirty seconds before this photo, there was nothing. Black sky. Then, without any ramp-up, the sky turned green.

This shot is from midnight, almost on the button; probably 12:00:30 or so. The lights along the bottom are vehicles on the Trans-Canada Highway.
