# Featured on Studio 30 Plus

A while ago, I discovered [Studio 30 Plus](http://studio30plus.com/), a social network meant for writers over the age of 30. I can’t remember how I stumbled across the site — someone’s tweet or else a Facebook post — but I signed up, because hey, why not. Like-minded folk in similar situations, &amp;c.

Recently I was asked to contribute a featured post to the site’s blog. My post was slated for Tuesday, October 23rd. I was told that I was selected for Tuesday due to my (meagre) publication history, because Tuesday’s posts are dedicated to publishing and the like.

[So I wrote this](http://studio30plus.com/profiles/blogs/published), hoping it was at least close to what they were looking for.
