# Seems I&#8217;ve got quite the literary mentor

![](http://paulkienitz.net/quizpix/skiffy_jules.gif)I am: **Jules Verne**  
The 19th century Frenchman who made science fiction into a successful commercial genre.  
**[Which science fiction writer are you?](http://paulkienitz.net/skiffy.html)**

So now I’ve been compared to [Ray Bradbury](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/fiction/short/map-end-world/), [Bret Easton Ellis, and Chuck Palahniuk](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/2004/12/06/because-this-is-the-kind-of-thing-blogging-is-meant-for/) (only two of whom I’ve read, by the by), and Jules Verne.
