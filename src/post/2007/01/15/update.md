# Update

Well, I got my problem figured out. I had to blow away my browser preferences and start fresh, but it works now. (If I’d had time and inclination, I probably could’ve used a less apocalyptic method, but, well, meh.)

Also: Last night I outlined about three-quarters of the middle act (which is where my long projects usually start to sag), and finished up the second chapter, too. More writing, if not tonight, then tomorrow for sure. Plus I got some more of the site for this serial-story project spruced up.

Stay tuned, and keep warm!
