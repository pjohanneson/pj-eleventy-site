# 13 things I have never read or seen

EDMONTON—Everytime I say “I’ve never seen *Big Trouble in Little China*” I get an astonished gasp from my brother-in-law or from my friend the Space Cowboy. I tell people I’ve never read *Lord of the Rings*\* or *The Hobbit* and they give me that sideways look like a quizzical dog, as if to say “How do you *live*?”

So here’s a list of things I’ve not read or seen. Things that may surprise you. Or may not.

1. *Solaris*–neither the book by Stanislaw Lem, nor either of the film versions.
2. *Gladiator*, the film by Ridley Scott.
3. *Titanic*, the endless movie by James Cameron.
4. Any of Isaac Asimov’s *Foundation* novels.
5. Any of Isaac Asimov’s novels, in fact. I’ve read some of his short fiction, but I just couldn’t get into the novels, no matter how hard I tried.
6. *Deep Impact*. I saw the other disaster movie that year, *Armageddon*, and thought, Meh.
7. Robert A. Heinlein’s *Stranger in a Strange Land*, though I know what “grok” means.
8. *Eragon*, and I have no intentions of reading it either. Or seeing the movie.
9. *Cowboy Bebop* or most anime. For whatever reason, anime doesn’t turn my crank, although some people seem to assume it should.
10. *Seven Samurai* or in fact any of Kurosawa’s corpus. This I intend to remedy.
11. Any Shakespeare short of a couple [sonnets](http://flickr.com/photos/pj/99922259/) and *Macbeth*. This too needs to be remedied.
12. Any of the egregious *Dune* prequels. IMHO, they should’ve just published Frank Herbert’s notes and called it a day.
13. *The Stand* mini-series, something which I still hope to see sometime.

\* Not strictly true; I started, but around the middle of the second book, I realized that I was reading a highly-detailed travelogue, where I had been expecting an action epic.
