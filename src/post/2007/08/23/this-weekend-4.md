# This weekend

Well, this weekend, up until Wednesday.

Friends of ours came into town, from all the way out in Saskatchewan, so we had some fun. My friend Kevin owns a couple dirtbikes, so I went dirtbikin’ for the first time ever.

We went out to the Double Decker, too. For bonus points: How many shots of tequila came to our table, and who shared them?

I think we’re finally back to our regular sleep patterns.
