# Thirteen irregular word uses

To quote Calvin (of Calvin and Hobbes fame): “Verbing weirds language”.

1. **Impact** is not a verb, no matter how often people say “the plane impacted into the mountainside”.
2. **Irregardless** is <s>not</s> a word. Regardless of what <s>you</s> I might think. (However, I still think it’s a <s>pointless word</s> *meaningless verbal bastard*. (Thanks, Doug!))
3. **Unthawed** means to freeze, not to make not frozen.
4. You **borrow** things *from* someone, not *to* someone.\*
5. **Alot** is *two words*: “a lot”.
6. **…looks on** has reached its saturation point in newspaper photo captions.
7. I find it irritating to be mocked by Americans for pronouncing “about” as *aboot*\*\*—especially when I continue to hear the word **roof** pronounced as *ruff* by some of our neighbours south of the border.
8. Even though [it’s a real word](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=orientate), **orientate** gets my goat. There’s a perfectly good word already, and it’s *orient*.
9. Unnecessary non-standard words, used in an effort to sound eloquent, such as **utilized** where *used* would suffice, or…
10. …**at a high rate of speed** for *fast*. These always strike me as terms used by people trying to sound intelligent; unfortunately they usually make them sound pompous.
11. **Comprised of** annoys me. It should be “composed of”. Both of the following are correct: “The band trip was composed of thirty-five high school students.” “Nineteen wolves comprised the whole of the zoo. What a boring zoo trip that was.”
12. My high-school gym teacher once told us, before a ski trip, that we should dress warm, but not “like **the abdominal snowman**“. I was the only one in the gym that laughed.
13. **Thursday** is not a verb, but I feel like I’ve been Thursdayed.

\* This is a French thing, and I hear it in my hometown, but not in the town where I now live. It’s because *en français*, the verb *prêter* means both “to borrow” and “to lend”. It’s a vectored verb, in that it has a direction. (If “vectored verb” isn’t a grammatical term already, I hereby coin it.)

\*\* Which is a pronunciation I’ve never heard in Canada, by the by.
