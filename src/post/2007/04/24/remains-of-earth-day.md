# Remains of Earth Day

So yesterday there were a bunch of people on campus, celebrating Earth Day. Today there was a sculpture left behind, and I can’t honestly tell if there’s a statement being made by the sculpture or not. It looks to my non-connoisseur’s eye like someone threw a bunch of small objects and bits of string in the air, and on the way down it all collided in such a way that the strings tied themselves around the objects. Then it all kind of landed on some twigs stuck in the ground. Sort of like a reversal of time’s arrow, a denial of entropy.

If I remember my camera tomorrow–and if someone hasn’t removed the art projects–I’ll take some photos, so you can see what I mean.
