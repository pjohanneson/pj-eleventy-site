# A couple of brief notes

To: **The local rock radio station**

Hi guys,

Ok, I think it’s official now. I’ve heard “The Black Parade” often enough for one lifetime. Time for you to find another song to overplay till I automatically switch stations on hearing its first few bars.

To: **The great toe on my right foot**

Look, it’s been, what, *three years* since I broke your neighbour doing judo? I mean, for cryin’ out loud, once he healed up, I never heard another peep out of him. You weren’t even broken—just jammed back a bit. I think it’s time you stopped getting it in your mind (whatever a toe has that passes for a mind, that is) to cause me pain.

Seriously. How long are you gonna keep this up, anyway? What? The rest of my life. Not cool, man. Not *remotely* cool.

To: **self**

Ok, it’s time to write a few more chapters in [*Everything that never happened*](/everything/). By the time Thursday rolls around, I’d like us to be at Chapter 24, please. If not further along than that, even.

That means no *Star Wars Lego* till you’ve got another thousand words tomorrow night, bucko. Trust me. I’m doing this for your own good.

Don’t you give me that look, Patrick.
