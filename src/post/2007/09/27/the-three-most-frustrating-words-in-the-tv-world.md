# The three most frustrating words in the TV world&#8230;

â€¦are *to be continued*.

Watching an episode of *Battlestar Galactica*, my one TV addiction, and all the players are in place: The Cylons have arrived, the humans are on the ground, about to be overrun by the enemy, and in orbit, *Galactica* has six nuclear weapons aimed down at the planet.

And the screen goes black and those three little words appear at the bottom of the screen.

Gaah!
