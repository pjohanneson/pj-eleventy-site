<div align="center">[![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/46/131813420_e5cccc4eec_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ingvigeir/131813420/ "IMG_6236 from flickr.com")  
[IMG\_6236](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ingvigeir/131813420/)  
Discovered in [Ingvi Geir (IGO)](http://www.flickr.com/people/ingvigeir/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>“Man, where *are* we, anyways?”

“Not sure. I think we should’ve taken–“

“If you say ‘a right turn at Albuquerque’ one more time, I swear by all that’s holy, I will *punch you* in the *nose*.”

“…Fine. Okay. So it’s not funny after a hundred thousand times. Lighten up, man.”

“Screw this. Give me the map. Your days as my navigator are *over*.”

“Still think we shoulda taken a right turn–“

“Don’t make me hit you, man. I will. I *swear* I will.”
