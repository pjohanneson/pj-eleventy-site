# IQ test

So we watched [Test the Nation](http://www.cbc.ca/testthenation/) last night. I did the test online, and came up with an IQ of 121. Then we did it on TV, and I ended up with 137. I think the 121 is probably more honestâ€“some of the questions were easier the second time around, since I knew, for instance, what they were going to ask for the memory questions, and could plan accordingly.

Interested in taking the test? Go to <http://www.cbc.ca/testthenation/> and try it out there.
