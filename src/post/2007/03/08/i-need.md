# What I need to carry on

For one thing, I need to buy this CD.

[What I Need to Carry On](http://radio3.cbc.ca/play/band/THE-SMALLS/What-I-Need-To-Carry-On/), by the smalls (from their last album, *My Dear Little Angle*\*)

\* No, thatâ€™s not a typo. The album name apparently came from a love note they found, with some questionable spelling.
