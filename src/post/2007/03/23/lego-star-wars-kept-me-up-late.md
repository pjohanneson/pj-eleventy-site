# Lego Star Wars kept me up late

For my birthday, my darling wife bought me Lego Star Wars (the original series one) for our PC. She also bought a second joystick so we can play the game together.

I tried it out last night. I sat down to play for 20 minutes while I waited for a TV show to start.

Two hours later I kind of came up for air.

All I can say is: Awesome!
