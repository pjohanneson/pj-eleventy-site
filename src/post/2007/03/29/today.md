# Today

**Work**: Got some Perl stuff pretty much finished up. Now I get to start in on the Content Management System.

**Judo**: Taught a couple new members three throws: [sasae-tsurikomi-ashi](http://www.judoinfo.com/images/nauta/sasaeta.gif), [ippon-seoi-nage](http://www.judoinfo.com/images/nauta/seoinage.gif), and [uki-goshi](http://www.judoinfo.com/images/nauta/ukigosh.gif).

**Weather**: Rainy all day; supposed to rain all night. Plus we’re getting a spot of lightning and thunder, the first I’ve seen since, oh, October sometime.

**TV viewing**: Tried to tape the season finale of *Battlestar Galactica* tonight, but my VCR did something wonky and I wound up with nothing. For the second time in a row. So I guess I’ll have to see if anyone I know managed to tape it…

**Overall**: Not a bad day, though I’d like to see a little sunshine.

G’night!
