So the [Co-op](http://www.heritagecoop.ca/) had a sale on case lots of mangoes. Ten mangoes in a box for five bucks. I couldn’t resist, especially considering that I have a recipe (from a Co-op flyer, in fact) for mango salsa.

Recipe below:

  
**Mango Salsa**  
2 ripe mangoes  
1 red bell pepper  
olive oil  
3 green onions  
jalapeño pepper(s)  
Zest &amp; juice of 1 lime  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 tbsp honey  
3 tbsp olive oil

Brush the mangoes with olive oil and grill, turning once, till grill marks appear. *\[This time, I did ’em up in the oven: about 3-4 minutes a side at 400°.\]* Cool, peel, and chop (I chop ’em in the food processor, since I’m lazy and it does a fine job.)

Seed and chop the peppers; dice the green onions. Add to the chopped mangoes.

In a small bowl, whisk together lime juice, zest, honey, salt, and the 3 tbsp of olive oil. Pour over the mango mix; toss to coat.

Aaaaand you’re done. Enjoy!

(The proportions are very forgiving; this last time I used 8 mangoes, but I only had one lime. Tastes just fine.)
