# The Oscars

So I watched part of the Oscars last night. I also played a video game during part of them, with the TV on in the background. While I was playing my game, I heard someone say that the Oscars had “gone green” this year. And I thought, Does that mean everybody walked to the theatre? Or rode bicycles? Or even used public transportation?

Then I thought, Who am I kidding?
