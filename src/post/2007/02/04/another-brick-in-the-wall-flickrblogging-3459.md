Discovered in [six times mighty](http://www.flickr.com/people/sixtimesmighty/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>“Dude… You’re playing ‘In The Flesh’… from ‘The Wall’… in front of… a wall…”

“Richie, please, man, you’re embarrassing me. You need to find a room and sleep it off. And maybe next time only have *one* of your brownies before the show.”

“…cosmic, man…”

“Richie, I don’t even know any Pink Floyd songs. I’ve been playing Mozart all damn night.”
