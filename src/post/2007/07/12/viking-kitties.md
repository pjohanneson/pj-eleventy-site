# Viking kitties

So I’ve been working in my basement for the last few weeks. This means I’ve been listening to rather more radio than I usually do.

There are two music stations in town that I like, and in the car I’ll switch back and forth quite happily between “Local Town’s Best Rock” and the college station. But in the basement, on my wife’s little pink stereo that she’s had for who knows how long, the college station doesn’t come in so well. (Unless you like static.) So I’ve largely been listening the Best Rock station. They like to play Led Zeppelin, and sometimes they like to play Led Zeppelin’s “Immigrant Song”.

Which would be fine, if I’d never seen [this](http://users.wolfcrews.com/toys/vikings/).

There. I dare you to not think of that little piece of online brilliance the next time “The Immigrant Song” comes on the radio.
