# Comedy gold

Here’s one more reason that I love [Corner Gas](http://www.cornergas.com/):

*Hank, thinking he’s psychic\*, tries to explain the disturbing dream he had the night before.*

**Hank:** I just, I woke up with this uneasy feeling.  
**Brent:** You ate cotton candy and pepperoni for supper last night. It’s a wonder you woke up at all.

\* Or *phycic*, as the Dog River Howler spelt it.
