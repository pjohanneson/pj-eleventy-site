# Tunes

I’m coming to really like [CBC Radio 3](http://radio3.cbc.ca/). Here are a couple reasons:

[What I Need to Carry On](http://radio3.cbc.ca/play/band/The-Smalls/What-I-Need-To-Carry-On/) by the smalls

> I need a pack mule  
> I need some camp fuel  
> I need a pack mule can carry a body, maybe two  
> I need a pack mule

And [Apocalyptic Modified Blues](http://radio3.cbc.ca/play/band/Corb-Lund-Band/Apocaplyptic-Modified-Blues/) by Corb Lund

> Have you made your peace with Odin and with Baal and Aphrodite  
> Cuz there’s a triple headed serpent here with one hell of a bite  
> And he knows you…  
> He knows you and laughs and locks the door
