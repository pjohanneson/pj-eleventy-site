# What I did with my summer vacation

Well, part of it, anyways.

I removed some moldy drywall from our basement bathroom a while ago, and I’ve been replacing it for the last little while. Well, actually, I’ve been hanging drywall yesterday and today; before that was some prep work, some more demolition, and a trip to the Peg to visit our respective sisters and their families.

Some of the demolition — pipes in the shower, and linoleum coming up.

The first drywall I’ve ever hung all by my lonesome.

Most of the drywall is up in this one.
