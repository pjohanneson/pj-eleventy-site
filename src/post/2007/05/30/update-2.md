# Update

It’s been a little while, hasn’t it?

Tonight I have judo. Next weekend I may be heading into the city for a coaching technical class. Yes, the two of them are related.

I’ve been working on [Everything that never happened](/everything/), but not enough. I need to get some serious writing done tomorrow.

[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) is, as I think I pointed out earlier, a bit like crack over DSL.

Xubuntu still rules, and still runs my nerd-box upstairs. It’s even lost its WiFi network connection less frequently and less catastrophically than the Windows box that it has replaced.

And that’s all I can think of now. More updates when I have something to say.
