# Fun, but not productive

So my wife bought me Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy a month and a half ago, for my birthday, and I’m addicted. I played tonight for a while (about an hour and a half, I think–time gets slippery when I’m in the throes of a nerd-game), and I managed to finish the “Story” play of The Empire Strikes Back.

The neat thing about the game, though, is that once you’ve played a given level through in Story mode, you can re-enter the level in Free Play mode, which allows you to take in any characters or vehicles you’ve unlocked or “bought” in the Mos Eisley Cantina (which serves as a home base). So I decided to try the first chapter of Empire again, only this time with some different vehicles: a TIE Interceptor and the *Millenium Falcon*, among others.

Then, as I was cruising along the icy wastes of Hoth, firing turbolaser cannons with gleeful abandon, I thought, Hmm, I wonder if I can get a screenshot. I pushed the `Print Screen` button, and lo, I ended up with this:

Awesome, I thought.

Then: I am *such* a nerd.

And… I got nearly zero writing done tonight. Maybe I burned out the other night when I did 3200 words in three hours, staying up *way* past my bedtime to do it.
