# Tonight&#8217;s ficlet

I try to make [my ficlets](http://ficlets.com/authors/pj) complete stories, but not ones that can’t have a sequel or a prequel added to them. It’s not easy to make a complete story in 1024 characters or less.

Here’s tonight’s effort:

**Right on the edge of the world**

> “Well that’s a fine how do you do,” muttered Rubin.
> 
> “What you mean, Rubin?” Arnie’s voice always annoyed Rubin, but since the plane crash it had acquired a grating quality. It set Rubin’s teeth on edge, it really did.
> 
> “We’ve come to the edge,” said Rubin. “See? The crick just flows on over…”
> 
> Arnie came up beside him. “So it do, so it do.” He stared down into the darkness for a long moment, then looked up at Rubin. His eyes were round and vacant like the moon. A little thread of drool had escaped his lip and glistened on his chin. “What’s that mean?”
> 
> Rubin sighed. “It means we turn around. Head upstream, hope we can find help…”
> 
> “We’s been walkin’ for days, though,” Arnie whined.
> 
> “*Dammit, Arnie, don’t you think I know that?*” Arnie recoiled from his brother’s fury, and Rubin sighed inwardly. He relented. “Sorry, Arnie. There’s no choice.” He smiled. “Know any good songs?”
> 
> “Do I!” They turned away from the void, and Arnie began to sing some idiot song. After a couple moments, Rubin joined in.
