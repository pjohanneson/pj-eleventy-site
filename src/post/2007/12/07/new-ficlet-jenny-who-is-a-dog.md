# New ficlet &#8212; &#8220;Jenny, who is a dog&#8221;

So I created a new ficlet this morning, called “Jenny, who is a dog”. For those of you that haven’t run across [Ficlets](http://ficlets.com/authors/pj), here’s the idea: You go to the Ficlets website, sign up or sign in, and then you can create a “ficlet”. A ficlet is a short-short story, or more accurately a part of a story. You have an upper bound of 1024 *characters*\* to tell your story. Anyone can add onto it by creating sequels or prequels. Every story on the site is licensed using a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) Attribution-Sharealike license.

So here’s my latest snippet of fiction:

> Jenny, who is a dog, came into the living room, sat down on the floor, and spoke. “What supper?” she said, tail thumping on the hardwood.
> 
> I stared at her. “Beg pardon?” I was shocked enough that I actually responded. To a dog. You see the state of mind I was in?
> 
> “Supper. Food. What?”
> 
> “Uh–” I’d been making my own dog food, these days. Jenny was old, and store-brand food wasn’t doing her any favours. “Liver and rice, for you,” I said. “I think pizza for me.”
> 
> “Good. Liver good,” she said, and trotted off to the dining room.
> 
> I went into the kitchen and got a beer out of the fridge. As I twisted the cap off, my phone rang.
> 
> “Y’ello?”
> 
> “Doug?” It was Lisa, my girlfriend. “Uh, Doug, I didn’t know who to call–”
> 
> “Calm down,” I said. “Deep breaths. What’s up?”
> 
> “Mr. Kit,” she said. “He’s–” She couldn’t go on.
> 
> “He’s talking?” I said, and there was silence on the line. I knew I was right. Mr. Kit, who is a cat, was talking too.
> 
> Jenny came into the kitchen and sat on the floor. “Jenny good dog,” she said.

And all day it kind of festered in my head. I kept thinking, what’s next? Where do we go from talking pets?

So I’ve decided to expand it into a short story (something more like 2,000 or 3,000 words, I’m thinking). Interested? Let me know in the comments, and when it’s complete, I’ll email you a link to read the whole thing.

\* Which works out to about 200 words.
