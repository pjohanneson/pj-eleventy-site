# Parallel Prairies review

This is the first review I’ve come across for the new made-in-Manitoba anthology *Parallel Prairies*, and I’m glad to say the reviewer appears to have enjoyed my short story “Vincent and Charlie”.

> Another rural close encounter of note in the collection is Brandon-based Patrick Johanneson’s Vincent and Charlie. The story explores the concept of alien telepathy and memory manipulation from inside a mind descending into dementia. Johanneson finds an artful balance between suspense and sentimentality and adds a soupçon of Men in Black for good measure.
