# Roasted vegetable soup

This is where the long-ass story goes, right? The one you scroll past, muttering *Just show me the freakin’* *recipe!* under your breath.

It was cold outside yesterday. I had lots of [CSA (community supported agriculture) veggies](https://www.facebook.com/Maple-Valley-Farms-354805024553483/) in the house.

OK, story’s over. Here’s the recipe, such as it was:

1 large golden beet  
2 onions  
4 small potatoes  
2 carrots  
2 bell peppers  
1 middlin’ zucchini  
1 large patty-pan squash  
1/2 carton of leftover vegetable broth from the back of the fridge  
1 block of ice frozen in the vegetable broth carton (my fridge gets cold at the very back, apparently)  
1/2 carton of leftover beef broth  
1 cup of water

So here’s what I did: chopped up all the veggies, into cubes or slices about 1″ thick. Roasted them at 425°F for various times, till they were all nice and softened. The beet took about 45 minutes, all told; the potatoes, onions, and carrots took 30 minutes; the peppers and squash, about 15.

Then I pulsed ’em all in the food processor, till they were smooth but still a bit, well, rustic. I spooned the veggie pâté into a stock pot over medium heat, and stirred in the broths, the chunk of ice, and the water. Heated till it started to boil lightly, stirring every so often.

Served with cheddar-onion fougasse and finished off with a delicious slice of pumpkin pie, both from [Chez Angela](https://chezangela.ca/).
