# A not-entirely-dark, not-so-deserted highway

Half an hour’s worth of Earth’s rotation, along with the headlights of three or four vehicles traveling down Manitoba <abbr title="Provincial Road">PR</abbr> 468, under the bright light of October’s full moon. Also I think there are a couple airplanes crossing the sky. And clouds.

Nerdy tech details
------------------

*I’m not sure anyone but me will care about this, but so it goes.*

~200 images, 10s each, *f*/2.8, ISO 800. <abbr title="White balance">WB</abbr> was set to “Daylight”.

Lightly edited in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): I copied and pasted the main layer as two more layers, and set the middle one to Grain Merge, the top one to Hard Light. This darkened the background a bit and enhanced the lights.
