# Chris Hadfield

[Brandon University](https://www.brandonu.ca/), as part of its Homecoming this year, brought Colonel Chris Hadfield to Town to give a talk.

It was amazing. I came away inspired and hopeful.

My wife and I still have “Major Tom” stuck in our heads.

Also apparently I never quite gave up the boyhood dream of going to space.
