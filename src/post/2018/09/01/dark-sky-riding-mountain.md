# Dark Sky—Riding Mountain

I went up to Riding Mountain for the [Lights Out](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/mb/riding/activ/activites-events/ciel-etoile-sky) event.

My friend Tim was camping up there, too, so I went up a bit early and stopped in to see him. We went [elk bugling](https://www.purehunting.com/elk-calls-elk-calling-101/)—a birthday tradition of his—but the elks weren’t having any of it. Oh well.

After that I went to the park in Clear Lake, where the lights were well and truly out. It was dark enough that, more than once, I nearly stepped on someone because I couldn’t see them. Perfect conditions!

First I snapped some Milky Way shots. This one’s my favourite:

I set my timer for an hour, set my camera to take 15-second exposures, and sat down on a bench to listen to my shutter click.

After seven minutes, the lights came back on. Sodium lights, too, so it washed out everything, making the trees and the beach look orange.

So the header photo is 7 minutes’ worth of Earth’s rotation, instead of the hour I was hoping for. Oh well. It still turned out pretty good, I think.
