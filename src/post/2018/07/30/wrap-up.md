# Wrap-up

My goals for my writing retreat, 2018 edition, were pretty simple:

1. Get at least 10,000 words written in *Translations,* preferably more like 12,500.
2. Do some astrophotography and just general photography.
3. Do some kayaking and bike riding.

How’d I do?

At the start of the week, my novel sat at 65, 968 words. As I write this, I’ve just crossed the 80,000–word mark. So I managed 14,055 new words in this first draft. I’m happy with that—especially considering that I essentially took Friday off from writing.

Also, I got a pile of photos taken. I had hoped for some good shots of the Milky Way, but the moon was nearing full, so the skies were too bright for that. I did get a couple nice star-trail shots, though.

I also went to Winnipeg, for Chadwick’s book launch, and had a lovely chat in the evening with Mike &amp; Michelle, a couple friends I haven’t seen in a long time.

As far as kayaking—well, the weather didn’t cooperate. It was consistently around 20°C here this week, which is a bit chilly to go out on the lake. It’s supposed to hit 27 or 28 Monday, but by then I’ll be back at the office. I did go for a few bike rides, which was nice, and as I write this on Sunday, I’m planning one more before I pack up and leave.

So, on the whole, I’m going to call Writing Retreat 2018 a success. It’s been a productive, fun, glorious time, and I’m going to miss it.

Same time next year.
