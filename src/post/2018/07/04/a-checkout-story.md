# A checkout story

I stopped in at Co-op to get some groceries, and got in the shortest line I could find. The guy in front of me, man, he was a story.

He had a thin beard, grey eyes, and wore a basketball tank-top and a ball cap. His arms were tattooed with numbers and designs: a 12 on his left forearm, an ankh on one wrist, the word SATAN’S crawling down the inside of his right forearm.

He had a 2-litre bottle of store-brand cream soda, violently pink, and four packages of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. He paid his bill—$7.86—with a double fistful of dimes, and got 15¢ change back.

He’s got a story to tell. Probably quite a few of them, really. I just have no idea if I’m tough enough to hear them.
