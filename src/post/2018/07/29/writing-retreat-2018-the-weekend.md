# Writing Retreat 2018: The Weekend

Friday
------

The neighbours started showing up at their cabins on Friday. After having the run of the place, I had to reacclimatize myself to people. It wasn’t easy. (If I used emoji on this blog, there would be a winky face right here.)

The family to the north is having [Hydro](https://www.hydro.mb.ca/)-related issues (the short version is they have no electricity, and probably won’t till at least Monday). Ed, who owns the cabin where I live, let them run a couple extension cords from his outside plug so they could have refrigeration. In return, they’ve turned on their wifi and gave me the password. So now I can post without having to go down to the coffee shop in town (not that that was any great hardship).

I gave myself Friday off from writing, but I still did a bunch of writing-related business: I read out on the deck, I checked in on the status of “Me and the Bee” with the markets that have had it since February (one rejection, damn it, and one hasn’t yet replied) and did some research on [The Submission Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/), looking for a possible home for it. I’m starting to think I might just have to publish it here and be done, but I’ll wait a while longer.

In the evening I headed out to do some star-trail photography, but got about ten minutes out and the clouds rolled in, so I returned to the cabin and went to bed instead.

Saturday
--------

Saturday I finally got out onto the deck to do some writing. It was pretty nice, though it’s a little annoying having to shut my laptop down completely to move it from one plug to another (the battery’s shot, so it’s just the way it is).

I did my 1,250 words, then took a drive to Shilo with Kathleen and a couple others, where we served as non-skating officials (or “flamingoes”, thanks to the pink shirts we were given to wear) at [Scarlet Fever](https://www.facebook.com/WheatCityRollerDerbyLeague/)‘s decisive victory over a Winnipeg roller-derby team whose name, sorry to say, eludes me at the moment.

It was about midnight when we left the after-party (first in last out, woo), and then I hemmed and hawed about whether I’d go back to the cabin or sleep at home. In the end, the cloudless night convinced me, and I managed to get the photo above (star trails over a pond and canola field, just north of Minnedosa). It was 3 AM by the time I got to bed.

Sunday
------

And now here I am, out on the deck again, writing this post. Once it’s done, I’ll do my 1,250 words, and then I guess pack everything up and head home.

Thanks, Karen and Ed, for the use of the cabin. I really appreciate it.

Thanks, Minnedosa. It’s been great. Same time next year?
