# Writing Retreat, 2018: Tuesday–Thursday

Tuesday and Wednesday were a lot like Monday, except I didn’t set my alarm for 2:30 AM either day.

Thursday
--------

I got up, wrote, read, wrote some more, then headed to Winnipeg, to see my friend [Chadwick Ginther](https://chadwickginther.com/) launch his new novel, [*Graveyard Mind*](https://chadwickginther.com/2018/07/17/graveyard-mind-ebook-release-day/), at [McNally Robinson](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com).

None of them turned out, because I neglected to turn on the autofocus on my lens. But that’s OK, because I went back today (Friday) to scout the spot for a possible round of star trails later tonight, and I got this photo:
