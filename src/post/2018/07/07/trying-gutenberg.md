# Trying Gutenberg

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is the new big thing coming from and for WordPress. It’s a brand-new, radically-different editor for posts.

It’s slated to be included in WordPress version 5.0.0. Currently, as I write this, WordPress is at 4.9.7. So it’s coming very very soon—possibly as soon as August of this year (ie, 2018).

It’s available as a plugin in advance, so you can try it and see what you think. So far… so far I’m liking it.
