# Arabian Stars &#038; Constellations

A fascinating article on the [Planetary Society](http://www.planetary.org/) website: *[Whose Stars? Our heritage of Arabian astronomy](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2018/whose-stars-arabian-astronomy.html)*:

> Greco-Mesopotamian constellation figures bear Latin names. Their brightest stars are designated with letters of the Greek alphabet, yet most of them bear proper names that derive from Arabic. Even so, many of these star names are Arabic descriptions of Greek constellation figures, not Arabian ones.

[Learn more about the Arabian star and constellation names](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2018/whose-stars-arabian-astronomy.html), like, for instance, ath-Thuraya (aka the Pleiades) and her Hands (one amputated, one henna-dyed), Aldebaran (the Follower), al-Jawza’ and the Shi’ra sisters, and more.

It’s fascinating, and at least part of the reason I’m posting this is to bookmark the article for later re-reading. I think it might be a useful thing for a science-fiction writer to know about.
