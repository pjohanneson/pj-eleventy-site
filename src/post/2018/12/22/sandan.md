# Sandan

Judo Canada has ratified it, so itâ€™s official: I have my sandan rank. In English, I have my 3rd degree black belt in judo.

For this one, I had to learn (or perhaps re-learn is a better way to put it) the [katame-no-kata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js9mmSvojbo&t=59s), aka the groundwork kata. I quite like it, and hope to sharpen it up for possible competition.

Thanks to all who have supported me along the way.
