# Christmas movies

Is *Die Hard* the best Christmas movie? I dunno, I’ve always leaned toward *The Nightmare Before Christmas\**, myself.

But [this article](https://www.tor.com/2018/12/20/die-hard-is-great-but-shane-black-is-the-king-of-christmas-explosions/) makes a compelling point for others, too. I just re-watched *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* in the summertime, during [my writing retreat](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2018/07/30/wrap-up/). (How is that five months ago already? Man, time flies.)

> \[M\]ost of his films \[have a\] fairy-tale like sheen, similar to what makes *Die Hard* so successful. And making it Christmas in L.A. (which the majority of his films do), offers a different sensibility to the use of the holiday on film.

\* Oh who am I kidding? *Nightmare* is second; *A Charlie Brown Christmas* is first, even if it’s only about half an hour long.
