# Geminids

*In the photo above, I caught what I think was a C-130 Hercules turning. I think the military might have been doing some flight training.*

I caught a few meteors on camera tonight. It was mild in town, but the wind out in the country made it *very* cold.

I think I might have seen more meteors than I photographed, actually. They were all over the sky. And even the brightest two, in the photos below, barely show up.

I guess Iâ€™ve got some more learning to do about shooting meteor showers.
