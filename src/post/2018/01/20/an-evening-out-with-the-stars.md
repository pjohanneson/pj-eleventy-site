# An evening out with the stars

With some of the money I inherited from my dad, last year, I bought an 11-16mm *f*/2.8 lens for my camera. In plain English, it’s a nice fast lens with a nice wide field of view, which means that it’s great for astrophotography.

Tonight, the stars aligned for me, as it were. There was almost a 50/50 chance of some aurora sightings, per [SpaceWeather](http://www.spaceweather.com/). The temperature was a balmy -1°C, which was a pleasant change from the -25°C and -35°C nights we’ve had for the last couple weeks.

Long story short, there was a faint haze to the north. Editing with Gimp brings out quite a bit more than the naked eye could see.

As my camera clicked away, I leaned back against the car. At one point I thought of Kurt Vonnegut’s quote: *[If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3172-and-i-urge-you-to-please-notice-when-you-are).*
