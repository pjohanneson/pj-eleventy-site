# Eventually, there might be a Swanwick/Link interview

…and it’s sort of my fault.

It started with a request for book suggestions: Nikki was looking for books that “captured \[my\] soul”.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/AngelycDevil/status/1024443328497156096 </figure>I made a suggestion, naming a couple of my favourite short-story authors. (FYI, Kelly Link goes by @haszombiesinit on The Twitters.)

<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">> Kelly Link for sure. Also Jeffrey Ford and Andy Duncan. Astonishing writers all three.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure>I offered up my 2-year-old review of *Get in Trouble*.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/pjohanneson/status/1024736641510989825 </figure>Mr. Swanwick agreed with me.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">> I feel the same. Not sure she makes 'em up on the fly. But I'll admit to having no idea how they're created.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure>Kelly Link chimed in.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">> Really enjoyed this review &amp; also being included in this group! But in terms of actual process, I start with an ending and a structure and characters are then what I have to figure out so that I can navigate the shape I want to the place where I wish to leave them.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure>And then it all kind of snowballed.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">> Someday, with your permission, it would be interesting to interview you about how, step by step, you created one particular story.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">> I think I’d enjoy that.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">> I'll make a note to do that when I can free up the time. It'll be a few months, though.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure>So I’ve got that to look forward to. I hope it comes to pass; I think it’d be a fascinating interview.
