# Sabotage (Memories of JJ, #8)

Dad loved cop shows from the ’70s and ’80s. He wasn’t a big fan of ’80s and ’90s music, though. So imagine my surprise, one day, when, home for a weekend, I heard the dulcet tones of the Beastie Boys coming from the TV that he was watching. It was such an odd occurrence, in fact, that it took me a moment to recognize what I was hearing.

Then it clicked: it was the breakdown in “Sabotage”.

I came out of my room just in time for the lyrics to start up again, and Dad, realizing he’d been tricked, switched the channel.

I get it, though. It sure does look like an ’80s cop show.
