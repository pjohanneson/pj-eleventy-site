# A markèd improvement

I had laser eye surgery performed on the weekend. Today was my second follow-up appointment with the ophthalmologist.

My vision is now sitting at 20/16 with both eyes, which is apparently a step better than 20/20 or “perfect” vision. I gather that the 20/16 means that I can see at 20 feet what a normal person can see at 16 feet.

I had a look at the documents the doctor provided. Before the surgery, my good eye was at 20/400. My bad eye, well, they didn’t even bother with a 20/number, just marked OF 2ft (I assume “out of focus at two feet”).

Now all I need to do is get used to a life without glasses.
