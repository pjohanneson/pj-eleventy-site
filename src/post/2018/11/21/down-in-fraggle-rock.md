# Down in Fraggle Rock

*Today I learned that…*

Dennis Lee, Canadian poet, author of childhood favourite [“Alligator Pie”](https://canpoetry.library.utoronto.ca/lee/poem7.htm), was also the co-founder of the venerable Canadian press House of Anansi Press (which, even though I’m ill-versed in CanLit, I’d heard of).

*And* he wrote the lyrics to the theme song for *Fraggle Rock*.

*And* he co-wrote the story for the movie *Labyrinth.*
