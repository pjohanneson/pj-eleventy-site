# Stairs

You go up, you go down.

I saw [this stairway](https://twitter.com/wtfbuildings/status/1060708557560184832) on Twitter, and thought it looked, well, amazing. It made me nostalgic for the stairs in my childhood home, to wit:

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/217197023_37e82ad5cf_o.jpg)</figure>Dad made the risers. Theyâ€™re varnished wood, crazy slippery in sock feet, shaped like the end of a canoe paddle. The central column, if I recall correctly, was welded by a close family friend, Gilles.

Man, I loved those stairs. They were the best.
