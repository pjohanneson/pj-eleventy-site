# Sunday morning police blotter

This past Sunday I had to run a couple errands. As I left the house, I noticed there was a police car parked facing the wrong way on the street in front of the house a couple doors down.

When I returned there were about four police cars. I went up the back alley, planning to loop around and park in front of my house. But there was police tape strung across the back lane, and another police vehicle blocking the way. I backed out and parked further up my block. I made a mental note to check the police website later, to see if there were any details in the daily media release as to just what was going on.

Well, there were:

> On Sunday morning at approximately 07:52am, Police were requested to attend to a residence in \[my block\] for a female who had been stabbed multiple times in the arms, legs and mid-section. Police learned several items including the victim’s vehicle were stolen at the same time. Police believed two male suspects were involved \[note: turned out it was a single suspect\] and may be armed with firearm. \[…\] At approximately 6:10pm, the suspect was observed leaving the residence on \[another street\]. Police conducted a high risk vehicle stop and the suspect was arrested.

So yeah. Wow.
