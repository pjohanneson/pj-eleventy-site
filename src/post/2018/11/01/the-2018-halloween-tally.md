# The 2018 Halloween Tally

The Halloween tally:

- Mad scientist
- 2 members of a motorcycle gang
- Ninja
- Gypsy
- Day of the Dead
- Pirate
- Ghost
- 2 jailbirds

…for a total of 10 Halloweeners. (Plus two parents, dressed as Mary Poppins and Ben, who didn’t come close enough to get any candy.)

At judo: 0 kids. 5 adults. A nice quiet evening of flashcards and kata.
