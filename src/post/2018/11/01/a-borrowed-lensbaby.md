# A borrowed Lensbaby

Last week I got my hair cut. My hairdresser, like me, is an amateur photographer. We got talking lenses, and she said she had a [Lensbaby](https://www.dpreview.com/articles/7296350649/lensbaby-2-0) but had no idea how to use it. She offered to lend it to me.

I said “Sure!” I’ve been curious to try one out, to see what it could do, but not curious enough to buy my own.

I did some experimenting. It’s not like any lens I’d used before; you focus with two fingers, and you can maneuver it so that you’ve got a sharp focal point, and the rest of the image is blurred—almost motion blurred, really. It was interesting to use, but not something I’d probably buy for myself. Certainly not at full price.

Then last night—Hallowe’en night, no less—I glanced out the window as I was getting my stuff together for judo. After a day of unbroken clouds, I saw that the sun had broken through, and was throwing golden light everywhere. I raced upstairs with my camera (which still had the Lensbaby attached) and snapped the above photo, of the trees in my front yard.

I like it. I think it turned out pretty good.

Now I think I need to do some more learning with the Lensbaby.
