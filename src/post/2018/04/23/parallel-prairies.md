# Parallel Prairies

**Update:** The Brandon launch of Parallel Prairies will happen during [Brandon University’s Homecoming celebration](https://events.brandonu.ca/event/alumni-authors-and-book-launch/).

**Update:** [The book now appears on the publisher’s site.](http://www.greatplains.mb.ca/product/parallelprairies/)

Sometime this fall, my short story “Vincent and Charlie” will appear in [Great Plains Publications](http://www.greatplains.mb.ca/)‘ new anthology *Parallel Prairies* edited by [Darren Ridgely](https://twitter.com/DarrenRidgley) and [Adam Petrash](https://twitter.com/aetpetrash).

My story’s elevator pitch is “*ET*, with a retired farmer with dementia in the role of Elliott”.

Pre-order from: [McNally Robinson](http://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781773370033/darren-ridgley/parallel-prairies) | [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Parallel-Praires-Darren-Ridgley/dp/1773370030/)

Once I have more details about how &amp; where to order, launches, etc, I’ll be sure to post them.
