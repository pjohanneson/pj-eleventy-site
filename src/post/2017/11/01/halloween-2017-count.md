# Hallowe&#8217;en 2017 count

Here’s the tally for this year’s Hallowe’eners:

- Mad scientist
- Minion
- 2-year-old (approx.) in a bee costume who was apparently scared of me because I’m a stranger, and had to be convinced by her mother to accept a chocolate bar from me
- Morty
- Zombie banana (however *that* works)
- Princess
- Witch
- Vampire cat
- Cowboy in a snowsuit
- Cat in a snowsuit
- 3 more cowboys
- Ghoul with flashing red LED eyes that made him look like a dire Jawa
- Jason Voorhees in a parka
- Princess in a parka

First doorbell: 6:15 PM.

Last doorbell: 8:45 PM.

Leftover candy: sufficient but probably not fatal.
