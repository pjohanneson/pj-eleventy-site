# À la prochaine, Minnedosa

And thus ends the 2017 writing retreat. I’ll have a more detailed post later, but the précis is that I wrote 12,500+ words in *Translations*, had an epiphany that will change the last third of the story, took a bunch of photos, and drank a lot of iced coffee at Chipperfields as I used their wifi (much as I am right now).

Oh, and we bought a car.

Good times.
