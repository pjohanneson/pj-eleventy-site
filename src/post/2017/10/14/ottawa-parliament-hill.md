# Ottawa: Parliament Hill

Tuesday, I got up at the crack of 8:10 to go stand in line for Parliament Hill tour tickets. I assumed the office would open at 8:30, but it turned out to be 9 o’clock. I was glad I got there early, though, when I saw how very long the line had gotten behind me. Kathleen joined me with my camera and watch before the office opened.

We did the 9:50 AM tour, which was shorter and less interesting than the one we took spontaneously in summer 2012. (As my uncle Marc pointed out later, though, that was before the events of 2014 — the active shooter incident on the Hill.) We chose to check out the Peace Tower too, because we missed out on it in 2012, and seriously, who wouldn’t? We got some amazing views of Ottawa from on high. (Also we stumped the page with a question about what the engraved porticullis above the door to the elevator signified. It wasn’t in his book, and the constable said he’d never even noticed it before.)

Back on the main level, we were just in time for the daily Turning of the Page ceremony in the Memorial Chapel. It was apparently the first time the constable had performed the ceremony. I thought he did very well. When the Turning of the Page was complete, we entered the Chapel, and read some of the names in each of the memorial books.

We were too early to join the line for Question Period, so we posed at the Canada 150 sign on the grounds, then found a Provençal-themed restaurant and had lunch.

Back at Parliament, we re-entered Centre Block, went through security again, then headed up to the line for the Viewing Gallery. Through another round of security, where we surrendered our phones, our coats, and my camera (thus, no photos), and then into the seats in the gallery.

Then, as Kathleen put it, we watched the sausage being made. The opposition pressed the government for answers, and the government snarked, redirected, and hit the talking points. As you do.

After that, we got the car out of the hotel’s parking lot, and braved the rush-hour traffic on the 417 to get to a restaurant in nearby Gloucester. We had supper with a smattering of Moreaus (Moreaux?): Marc and Veronica, Jordan and his girlfriend Tara, Stephanie and her husband Corey, Chad and his fiancé Katherine. We filled up, then did some quick Walmart shopping (yogurt, OJ, cheese — you know, breakfast necessities) and headed back to the hotel.

Jackhammers again, but they stopped at 9:45. I checked Ottawa’s noise bylaw, and construction noise is supposed to stop at 10 PM.
