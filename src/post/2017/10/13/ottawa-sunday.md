# Ottawa: Sunday

We’d travelled to Winnipeg on Saturday, because our Sunday flight was an early one. Got to the YWG airport in plenty of time to go through security (unlike a woman behind us in the security line, who said to the officer, “My flight’s in 15 minutes,” to which he responded, “You should’ve got here sooner then”).

Uneventful flight, or I guess flights: Winnipeg to Toronto, where we changed gates and got on the Toronto-Ottawa flight. Kathleen watched *Bon Cop Bad Cop* *2* on the flight, and I snoozed and watched the very first *Silicon Valley* episode.

In Ottawa, we got the rental car, found the hotel, checked in. Then we wandered around the downtown, discovering we were literally three blocks from Parliament Hill. The War Memorial was easy to find, and in our aimless sauntering we also discovered the US Embassy, the Mint, the National Gallery, the Rideau Canal, and Byward Market, among many other points of interest. We paused on the National Gallery’s plaza to admire the silver towers of Notre Dame Cathedral Basilica across the street. Also the giant spider on the plaza was pretty interesting.

We found a Darcy McGee’s, which had been recommended to us, and ate on the patio, then bought tickets next door for Monday evening’s [Ghost Walk](https://hauntedwalk.com/ottawa-tours/).

We got back to the hotel about 6:30 and climbed into bed. I read, briefly, then fell asleep before 8 PM, for which Kathleen laughed at me for the next couple days.
