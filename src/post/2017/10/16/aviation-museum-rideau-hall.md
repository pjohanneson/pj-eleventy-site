# Canadian Aviation Museum / Rideau Hall

We had a lazy morning: breakfast in the room, showers, and so forth. We left the hotel about 11 AM, and drove out to the Aviation Museum, where I got to indulge one flavour of my nerdiness (including wearing a fighter-jet helmet during the ejection seat demonstration).

After lunch, we headed to our 3 o’clock tour of Rideau Hall, home of [the newly-installed Governor General, Her Excellency Julie Payette](https://www.gg.ca/index.aspx).

After that, we took about an hour to travel what the GPS said should take 9 minutes. (Never get lost during rush hour, kids.) We made it to the [MosaïCanada gardens](http://english.mosaicanada.ca/) in Gatineau just in time for a cloudburst, so we waited it out in the car. As we were finishing up the tour — like, in sight of the “Sortie / Exit” arrows — it started to rain again.

We headed off to Stella Luna for supper, but ended up finding the Mill Street Brew Pub sign instead. We called from the parking lot, and they said it was a half-hour wait. (Turned out to be almost an hour, but that’s OK, we sat at the bar and had tasting flights. I enjoyed the Milkshake Cream Ale — IPAesque with floral notes — and Kathleen loved the Welterweight IPA, which is weird because she dislikes IPAs as a general rule.) Supper was amazing.

Back to the hotel, and crash into bed.
