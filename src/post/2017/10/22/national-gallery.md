# National Gallery

We headed out around noon, and walked down to the Canadian National Gallery. We spent almost four hours touring the galleries, where I discovered that I prefer paintings of landscapes to portraits, generally, though I did find a few portraits interesting as well.

We started off on the 2nd floor, in the European and American section, working our way from the Renaissance to the 20th century. I identified the [Turner](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2015/02/18/the-fountain-of-indolence/) painting on sight, before I read the little tag, and I also geeked out a bit when I saw the Cornell box (Cornell’s work features in the first William Gibson novel I ever read, *Count Zero*).

We peeked into the Canadian Photography Institute, finding only one small display in there — the rest was closed for installation, we think. After lunch we checked out the Canadian and Indigenous section — the settlers sure liked their silverware — and found Voice of Fire, about which I remember a really big stink in the late 80s/early 90s. After that we quickly toured through the Contemporary exhibit, where I only took a few photos, as nothing really stirred me there.

(One day I’ll have to post a larger selection of the art from the Gallery. I took a lot — I mean *a lot* — of photos.)

By now it was after 4 PM, and we were due to meet up with Veronica just before 6. We made our way to the Byward Market, where we got some flowers for the Moreaux. Then we stopped in at the Lindt store, where we discovered that their 100-truffle bags were on sale. So we loaded up on chocolate (mmmmm) and then headed back to the hotel.

We managed to find the McNabb community centre, where I dropped Kathleen off with Veronica and Lianne to do some samba dancing. I headed out to Rockland to meet up with the rest of the Moreau family. We had pizza and salad, Jordan fed me a couple of dark beers (a Trappist one and one with a picture of Count von Count, which I doubt was licensed, on the side), and waited for the dancin’ ladies to arrive. When they did, they ate. (Census: Me, Kathleen, Veronica, Marc, Jordan, Stephanie, Corey, Chad, Lianne, and of course Keno, the dog, who hoped we’d drop some food.)

We played a couple rounds of Avalon, then seven hands (or so) of Golf, which I managed to win by getting Four Corners twice (the first time I’ve managed to do that, too). Kathleen likewise got her first Four Corners and came in second.

Then we had some delicious apple crisp and headed back to the hotel, where Kathleen crashed pretty hard and I wasn’t far behind falling asleep.
