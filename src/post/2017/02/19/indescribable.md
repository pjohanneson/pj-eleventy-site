# Indescribable

A couple years ago, [I had an epiphany](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2014/01/15/a-lesson-in-a-line/) while reading Gene Wolfe’s *The Book of the New Sun*, when the narrator Severian pointed out that

> It is always a temptation to say that such feelings are indescribable, though they seldom are.

Today, though… Today I was finishing Wolfe’s superb 1988 novel *There Are Doors*, and I happened upon this on page 294:

[!["An indescribable sound filled the arena"](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-1487529836348-600x338.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-1487529836348.jpg)

Which is it, Mr. Wolfe? *Which is it?*

- - - - - -

I must admit, though, it’s nice that, immediately after he calls the sound *indescribable*, he proceeds to describe it with delightful economy. Wolfe may be fond of unreliable narrators, but his prose is reliably amazing.
