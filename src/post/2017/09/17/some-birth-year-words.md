# Some birth-year words

Thanks to [Merriam-Webster’s “Time Traveler” feature](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-by-first-known-date/1973), I now know that the following words’ and phrases’ first recorded use happened the year I was born:

- [bikini wax](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bikini%20wax),
- [fight-or-flight](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fight-or-flight),
- [razor wire](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/razor%20wire),
- [postfix notation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postfix%20notation),
- [deconstruct](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deconstruct),
- [gamma-ray burst](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamma-ray%20burst), and probably my favourite,
- [space cadet](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/space%20cadet).

And dozens of others, too. How about you?

(Maybe later I’ll indulge in a [caipirinha](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caipirinha).)
