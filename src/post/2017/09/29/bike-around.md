# Bike Around

Speaking as someone who watched his father slide into dementia, [this is very interesting](https://www.google.ca/about/stories/bike-around/).

> To combat \[memory loss, researcher Anne-Christine Hertz\] built a prototype called BikeAround, which pairs a stationary bike with Google Street View to take dementia patients on a virtual ride down memory lane. Patients input a street address of a place that means something to them—a childhood home\[,\] for instance—and then use the pedals and handlebars to “bike around” their old neighborhoods.

[Meet the researcher using Google Street View to help dementia patients with memory loss](https://www.google.ca/about/stories/bike-around/)—via Google.
