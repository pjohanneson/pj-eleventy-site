# Good job, Cassini

Cassini, the little probe that could, has finished its mission in the Saturn system with a suicide dive into the gas giantâ€™s clouds.

[It sent back myriad images and countless other data](https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/), improving our understanding of the solar system.

Thanks, Cassini. Much obliged.
