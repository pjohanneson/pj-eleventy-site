# Campfire Week

It was gorgeous out this weekend, simply beautiful. Highs of 29°C Saturday and Sunday. So I washed, like, all the laundry in my house and hung it on the line to dry on Saturday.

My neighbours decided to have themselves a fire in their backyard fire pit, about an hour before I brought my laundry in.

Long story short, every shirt I put on now smells like camping. Not that I’m complaining.
