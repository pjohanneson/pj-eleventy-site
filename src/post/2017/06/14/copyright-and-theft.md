# Copyright and Theft

*Read [Time to Fix Canada’s Copyright Mistake](https://medium.com/@jkdegen/time-to-fix-canadas-copyright-mistake-ef20b1103814) on Medium.*

It’s a tricky topic, and I’m by no means expert in it, though I like to think I’m a decently-well-read enthusiast. [I’ve actually had my stuff “appropriated” for educational purposes](https://medium.com/@jkdegen/time-to-fix-canadas-copyright-mistake-ef20b1103814) (one day I’ll have to write a longer post about it, but for now here’s the Coles Notes version, sans the angst and irritation I felt at the time).

My day job, which supports my writing habit, is at a university, and so I know the appeal of not paying for things, since budgets are traditionally tight, even under the most small-l liberal of governments.

Canada does indeed need to address its copyright issues.
