# Memories of JJ, 7 &#8212; Sartorial splendour

If you knew Dad, you knew he had his own sense of style. He wore moccasins as much as he possibly could\*. In the summertime, if he wasn’t wearing moccasins, then he was barefoot. (Well, maybe sandals.)

At work and at play, he’d wear blue jeans and a button-up short-sleeve shirt. Later, after I’d left home, he discovered denim shirts. There was always a pen or a mechanical pencil in the shirt pocket, and usually a tube of Certs. (Remember Certs?)

The only time you’d see his legs was at the beach, in a bathing suit\*\*. Otherwise, like I said: jeans.

\* I wore jeans and moccasins at his funeral. It just seemed right.

\*\* Which reminds me of another fun time. We were camping up at Blue Lakes. My sisters and I were swimming, and the water was *cold*. Like, my thumbnails turned blue cold. Dad, from the shore, asked how the water was. “Fine,” we said, and he ran in. And then complained all the rest of the weekend—and for *years* later, let me tell you—about his damn kids lying to him.

*[My dad passed away recently.](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2017/01/11/my-fathers-obituary/) I hope you’ve enjoyed my little memorials to him. This is the last one in the series, but rest assured, I’ll probably mention him again. Thanks for reading.*
