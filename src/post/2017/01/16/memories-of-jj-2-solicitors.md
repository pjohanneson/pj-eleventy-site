# Memories of JJ, 2 &#8212; Solicitors

I was about twelve. Dad was watching the news on CBC. There was a report about prostitution, and the reporter made the point that, in Canada, prostitution was legal, but soliciting a prostitute wasn’t. I was old enough that I had a handle on what *prostitution* was but I was confused about *solicitation*. So I asked Dad.

He explained that solicitiation meant, in essence, a prostitute offering sex for money.

“Oh,” I said. After a moment I asked, “So why do they call him the [Solicitor General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_Canada)?”

Dad laughed harder than I think I’d ever seen him laugh in his life\*. He never did answer my question.

\* One thing I inherited from Dad is the way he laughed. He would find a lot of things mildly funny, enough for a smirk or a smile, but you knew he’d really been tickled by something if he guffawed, loud and usually with little warning.

*[My dad passed away recently.](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2017/01/11/my-fathers-obituary/) I’m going to be posting little memories of him for the next little while. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.*
