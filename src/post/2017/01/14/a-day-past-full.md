# A day past full

I shot some photos of the moon through the branches using my longest lens (55-250mm), and was quite pleased how they turned out.

Then I retreated indoors (it’s frickin’ freezing out there) and wrote about 800 words in a new Prairie SF short story. First contact with a farmer. We’ll see where it leads.
