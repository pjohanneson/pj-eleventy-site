# Jim Johanneson

This is my dad, Jim Johanneson. “JJ” to his students, his co-workers, and his friends. “Jimmy Danger” to his sons-in-law.

A couple days ago, he left this world. I miss him but I know he’s not feeling any pain now.

I will surely say more later, but for now: Thanks, Dad.

Donations
---------

If you’re interested in making a memorial donation in Dad’s honour, here are the charities we as a family have selected:

- [The Canadian Alzheimer Society](http://www.alzheimer.ca/)
- [The Canadian Foodgrains Bank](http://foodgrainsbank.ca/)
- Dr. Gendreau Personal Care home — Box 60, Ste. Rose du Lac, MB R0L 1S0

If you’re interested in sending flowers, please, spend the money on one of the above charities. If you want to leave a note of condolence for us, the ones left behind, you can do so on [the funeral home’s site](http://www.sneathstrilchuk.com/jim-jj-johanneson/).
