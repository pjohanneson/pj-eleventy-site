# Let&#8217;s Talk

*Hey. Just a warning: This isn’t an easy read. It wasn’t easy to write, either.*

- - - - - -

Today is January 25th, when Bell, inspired by a spirit of boundless compassion\*, [will give a pile of money to mental health initiatives](http://letstalk.bell.ca/en/), so long as you tag your discussion correctly. So… here’s my 5¢ worth, I guess.

As some of you know, [my dad recently died](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2017/01/11/my-fathers-obituary/). He was in a nursing home for years before he left us, a victim of pretty severe dementia. So in a way, he died twice: once in the mind, slowly falling away over years, and then in body, later, more quickly.

Even before the dementia became apparent, there were hints of depression. Maybe things could have been different if he’d spoken up, or if we’d asked the right questions. (Let’s talk, Dad.) Hindsight is, of course, always 20/20, but Dad just wasn’t the type to talk about these things. (Neither am I, really. Not usually.)

I’m like Dad in a lot of ways. I look like him, I sound like him, and many of his mannerisms and turns of phrase are deeply ingrained in me too. We both love science fiction. We both lack a spleen, thanks to a genetic condition whose name I never learned.

But I’m also *unlike* him in a lot of ways. I do my best to go to the gym, which I think he might find a foreign concept. I don’t like canned peas (grey salty sadness pellets), I enjoy kiwifruit and yogurt, I read the occasional fantasy novel.

Sometimes—not very often, but sometimes—I wonder if his fate is my fate. People tell me that it’s not, and I do my best to listen.
