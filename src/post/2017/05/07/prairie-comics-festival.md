# Prairie​ Comics Festival

I went today to the [Prairie Comics Festival](http://prairiecomics.com/). Reconnected with some writer friends (Chadwick, Sam, and Jamie), made some new connections (hi, Donovan​), and regretted not bringing along my business cards (at least three people asked about WordPress stuff).

But I picked up a bunch of local art, so at least there’s that.

- *Mini Book of Monster Girls* by Autumn Crossman
- *Eggman Colouring Book #1* by Gabrielle Ng
- *How to be Human* by Kathleen Bergen
- *Street Style Samurai* by Jamie Isfeld
- *Those Who Make Us* with short stories by Chadwick Ginther and Corey Redekop, among others
- *Winterpeg* by Matthew Dyck
- *Spacepig Hamadeus* by Donovan Yaciuk
- *The Rangeroads*  by Courtney Loberg

I look forward to a lot of reading.
