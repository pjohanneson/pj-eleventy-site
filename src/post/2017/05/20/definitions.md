# Definitions

For a scene in my current work in progress, I wanted to know what the proper term is for the skullcap worn by bishops in the Catholic Church. So I Googled *archbishop skullcap,* as you do.

The word is *zucchetto.* It comes from the Italian for … Pumpkin. (Because, apparently, the little caps—worn to keep the bishops’ heads warm—reminded people of pumpkins cut in half.)

I ended up going with “archbishop’s skullcap” in the manuscript.
