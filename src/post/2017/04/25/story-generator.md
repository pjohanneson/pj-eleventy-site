# Story Generator

The page bills itself as [The Best Story Idea Generator You’ll Ever Find](http://thejohnfox.com/2016/05/story-idea-generator/), and when it dispenses gems like this:

> Have your character attend a themed costume party where they can’t find the person that invited them, they know nobody else, and the people they meet are alternately hostile and friendly. What is the strange theme of the costumes, and does your character stay or run after a disaster happens?

…it’s hard to call that an exaggeration.
