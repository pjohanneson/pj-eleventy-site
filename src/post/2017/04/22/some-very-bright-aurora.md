# Some very bright aurora

I could see them already while I was still in the city. By the time I got to my nice, dark spot, this is what I could photograph:

They stretched from the northeast to the southwest. They were bright enough for a while that I could watch them dancing with the naked eye. The last time I remember seeing them this bright, I was a teenager in Ste. Rose, lying on the grass, looking up.

Also: a video version:

An hour of my evening well-spent, Iâ€™d say.
