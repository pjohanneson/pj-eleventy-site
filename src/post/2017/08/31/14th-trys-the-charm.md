# 14th try&#8217;s the charm

I really like my short story “The Overnight Shift”. I wrote it last summer, in a weekend, at the start of my 2016 writer’s retreat. It was originally written as a contest entry in the [NYC Midnight](http://nycmidnight.com/) flash fiction contest.

Since I wrote it, I’ve been trying to sell it. It’s right at the 1,000-word mark, making it what they term *flash fiction*. There are a decent number of paying markets for flash fiction, and I was starting to think I was going to have to try them all.

That is a screenshot of my [Submission Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/) screen for “The Overnight Shift”. The numbers in the square brackets at the end? That’s \[the number of current open submissions for a piece / the number of submissions this year / the number of all-time submissions\]. Those 14 are all the times I’ve sent this piece out into the world. 13 times running, it was rejected (twice it made it to the second round, where it was then pruned).

And finally, this week, I sold it. It will appear sometime in November in [The Arcanist](https://thearcanist.io/), a relatively new online SF/F ’zine featuring flash fiction.

I’ll be sure to post here when it goes live. Trust me, you won’t be able to keep me quiet about it.
