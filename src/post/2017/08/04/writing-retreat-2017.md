# Writing Retreat 2017

As is rapidly becoming tradition, I spent most of the last week of July in a friend’s cabin up at Minnedosa. *(Thanks, Karen &amp; Ed!)* [My goals for the week are posted here](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2017/07/23/hold-my-calls-2/), and here’s how it went:

Beat sheets for the major characters in *Translations*
------------------------------------------------------

I have a complete outline for the POV’s arc, which is the most critical as it’s narrated in the first person.

Also, I had a major epiphany about the POV character, one that will shake up the last ⅔ of the book.

10,000 words in *Translations*
------------------------------

I wrote 12,500 words in *Translations*, the bulk of it written as I sat on the deck, pretty much all alone in the cottage area.

At least a few shots of the Milky Way
-------------------------------------

Yeah, that turned out okay.

Having access to a car this year really helped me get to the dark places (literally) so that I could get some great photos of the night sky.

Also, I sold a print of one of my photos to a friend. *(Thanks, Brianne!)* Does that mean I’m a pro now?

Lots of bike riding
-------------------

Well. My bike’s left pedal arm has been coming loose more and more frequently. It’s got to go into the shop. On my first ride in Minnedosa, I had to stop twice to tighten the pedal arm, both times on my way up a hill. So after that, *feh* to bike riding. (At least, my bike in its current condition.)

Fortunately, I had access to a kayak *(thanks, Carla!)*, so I put in about 15 km of paddling time, going up and down the lake.

Stretch goals
-------------

I read [James S. A. Corey](http://www.jamessacorey.com/)’s amazing [*Leviathan Wakes*](http://www.jamessacorey.com/books/leviathan-wakes/), courtesy of [my public library’s e-book program](https://manitoba.libraryreserve.com). I’m now hooked, and need to read the rest of the Expanse saga.

I also re-read the first ⅔ of [Gene Wolfe](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/sci-fis-difficult-genius)’s subtle and mysterious [*The Fifth Head of Cerberus*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/845501.The_Fifth_Head_of_Cerberus), which, I’m not gonna lie, probably had at least a little bit to do with my aforementioned epiphany. (It’s also the first Wolfe novel I’ve re-read, and[ it’s amazing how much less confusion I feel, how much more I’m picking up](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2017/08/13/my-heads-swimming-now/).)

And we bought a second car, which is why I could have a vehicle to go gallivantin’ around the countryside, looking for dark locations to get photos like this:

I think that went well.
