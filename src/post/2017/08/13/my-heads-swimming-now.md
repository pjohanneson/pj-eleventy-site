# My head&#8217;s swimming now

I recently finished my re-read of Gene Wolfe’s *Fifth Head of Cerberus*. Feeling pretty smug, thinking I’d caught a *lot* more than I’d picked up on first reading it, I Googled `fifth head of cerberus analysis`, which led me to a passel of articles on Ultan’s Library, including [Proving Veil’s Hypothesis](http://ultan.org.uk/variance-reduction-techniques/) \[warning: many, many spoilers\] . And… wow.

I had no idea.

I still have no idea.

But I’m glad there’s at least one writer out there as subtle, as sneaky, as sly, as Gene Wolfe.
