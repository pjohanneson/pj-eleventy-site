# Lasagna

I don’t know about you, but for me, lasagna((Especially the lasagna Florentine my dad taught me to cook.)) is the perfect comfort food. When it’s in the house I will happily eat it at every meal till it’s gone.

This time I snapped a photo or two before I devoured it all.

------------------

- 9 lasagna noodles
- 2lb ground beef
- mushrooms
- tomato-based pasta sauce
- tub of ricotta cheese((You can use cottage cheese but it’s not quite the same.))
- about two handfuls of spinach, chopped
- shredded mozzarella cheese

Cook the noodles per the package (mine were boiled for 8 minute). Brown the beef in a pan till no pink remains; stir in the pasta sauce and the mushrooms. Stir the spinach into the ricotta.

Layer ½ the beef-and-sauce mix in the bottom of a 9×13″ pan. Lay 4 or 5 noodles over it. Put the entirety of the ricotta-and-spinach mixture on top of the noodles. Lay the remaining noodles over that. Cover with the rest of the beef, then cover that beef with the mozzarella.

Bake at 350°F for 20–30 minutes. Dig in. (I find it tastes even better the 2nd day.)
