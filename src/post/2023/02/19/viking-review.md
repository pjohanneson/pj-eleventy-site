# Viking (review)

Tonight I showed / watched the movie *[Viking](https://evanstheatre.ca/movie/viking/)* at the [Evans](https://evanstheatre.ca/).

Five astronauts have been sent to Mars. Meanwhile, back on Earth, the Viking Society gathers five other people—their psychological profiles matched as closely as possible with the Martian astronauts—to try and head off any possible problems on the Red Planet.

But they’re only human, so naturally things go a bit wrong. Some take things a bit too seriously; others, not nearly seriously enough.

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_mdIEDJwNw?feature=oembed" title="VIKING Trailer | TIFF 2022" width="500"></iframe></div></figure>I thought the movie was pretty good. It was quite funny until suddenly it wasn’t funny at all anymore. I was amused at the acronym for the analog NASA (ASEA, the American Space Exploration Agency; people in the movie definitely were asea). I think the fact that most of the music reminded me of the soundtrack to the short film “[They’re Made Out Of Meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6JFTmQCFHg)” added to my amusement.

Once the turn from comedy to tragedy((Maybe “tragedy” is too strong a word; drama?)) happened, I was still locked in to the story. The scene near the end in the phone booth felt pretty raw to me.

Smile and say “astronaut”.
