# Comet chasing

I went out to see if I could get any photos of [C/2022 E3 (ZTF)](https://www.timeanddate.com/news/astronomy/green-comet-2023) tonight, but the moon is far, far too bright. It was kind of a relief, honestly; it’s ridiculously cold tonight (like, pushing -30°C *before* the wind gets factored in). I snapped a couple photos, but I couldn’t see anything resembling a comet in them.

It wasn’t nearly as successful an attempt as [the last time I went comet chasing](https://patrickjohanneson.com/tag/comet-neowise/).
