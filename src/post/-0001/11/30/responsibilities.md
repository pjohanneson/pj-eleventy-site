# Responsibilities

I saw a photo from an anti-mask protest on the weekend. A smiling, tow-headed kid held up a sign that said *Your health is not my responsibility.* It made me want to sit down with him and tell him his parents have failed him. My health and my well-being *are*, in fact, his responsibility, and his health and well-being are mine. That’s what living in a civilization costs.

As Red Green said, “Remember, I’m pullin’ for you. We’re all in this together.”
