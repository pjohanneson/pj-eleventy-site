# 13 openers

The start of a novel or a short story is of incredible importance. The writer has about one or two sentences (in a short story) or maybe a whole page (in a novel) to snare the reader, to make him or her want to continue reading. These are all openers from some of my favourite novels, all of which I’ve read at least twice. See if you can figure out what the novels are; highlight the text after the –&gt; <span style="color: #fff;">like this</span> to see if you’re right.

1. The bureaucrat fell from the sky. –&gt;<span style="color: #fff;">Stations of the Tide, by Michael Swanwick</span>
2. The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. –&gt;<span style="color: #fff;">The Gunslinger, by Stephen King</span>
3. “In five years the penis will be obsolete.” –&gt;<span style="color: #fff;">Steel Beach, by John Varley</span>
4. “Tonight we’re going to show you eight silent ways to kill a man.” –&gt;
