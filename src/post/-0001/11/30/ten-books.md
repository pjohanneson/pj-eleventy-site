# Ten books

Ten books that have had an impact on me:

1. *Stations of the Tide* — Michael Swanwick.
2. *The Forever War* — Joe Haldeman.
3. [*Norse Gods and Giants*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_Gods_and_Giants_%28Ingri_and_Edgar_Parin_d%27Aulaire%29) by the D’Aulaires.
4. *The Book of the New Sun* — Gene Wolfe.
