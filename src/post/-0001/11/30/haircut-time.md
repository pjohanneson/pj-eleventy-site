# Haircut Time

My lovely wife Kathleen has been growing her hair for four years now. She wanted to see how long it would get before it drove her crazy, and (more importantly) she wanted to be able to donate it so that it could be made into wigs for cancer patients, people with alopecia, or anyone who needed it.

I went along with my camera, to document the process.
