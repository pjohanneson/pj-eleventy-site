# Ah, spring

It must be spring. I drove around with a window and the sunroof open. I saw at least two people riding motorcycles. I smelled barbecued meats on the air.

And I saw an adorable little blonde girl walking down the sidewalk with her father, wearing a pink raincoat, green dress, rubber boots, and a princess crown made out of a paper bag.

Now I just need all this snow to melt from my yard.

Update.
-------

*April 12th:* The snow melted, and has now returned. That was rather an underwhelming summer.
