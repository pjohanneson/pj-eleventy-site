# The Hallowe&#8217;en Tally

[![Hallowe'en tally](https://live.staticflickr.com/3937/15497279730_59c1f62205_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/15497279730/)

For those that can’t read my scrawl:

- Butterfly \[A little girl in purple. It was her first Hallowe’en, I’m guessing, since her mom was videotaping the whole thing, and, as she walked away from my door, I heard her say, *I got **candy**!*\]
- Princess w/ parka \[because this is Canada\]
- Bunny
- Clown
- Puppy
- Lion
- Spiderman
- Baby \[ie, no costume\]
- Parka-clad werewolf
- Spider-witch
- Nerd \[with a big wad of tape holding her glasses together at the nose — oh, the memories\]
- Zombie
- Batman
- 2 witches
- Black Queen \[Spades? Clubs?\]
- Zombie
- Blue Man
- Burlesque Hat Gal \[Couldn’t see much costume — parka — but she had one one of those miniature top hats burlesque performers wear (fascinators?)\]
- Princess in parka
- Creepy Clown
- Zombie \[These last two were quite a bit older — late teens — and showed up just before 9 o’clock\]

At 9:45 PM I shut off the outside lights and called it a night.

And now, if you’ll pardon me, there’s a Wunderbar with my name on it. Mmmmmmmm, leftover candy.
