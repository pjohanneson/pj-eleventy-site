# Miyazaki on writing

> I’ve become skeptical of the unwritten rule that just because a boy and girl appear in the same feature, a romance must ensue. Rather, I want to portray a slightly different relationship, one where the two mutually inspire each other to live – if I’m able to, then perhaps I’ll be closer to portraying a true expression of love.  
>  — Hayao Miyazaki ([source](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/4263.Hayao_Miyazaki))
