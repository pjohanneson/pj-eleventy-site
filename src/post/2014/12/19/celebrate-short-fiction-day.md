# Celebrate Short Fiction Day

On the shortest day of the Northern year, take some time to enjoy some short fiction.

[You can thank Pixel Hall Press for the idea.](http://www.pixelhallpress.com/CelebrateShortFictionDay.html)

Here’s some of my short fiction, free every day for you, but highlighted today as the solstice approaches:

*Some of these stories feature strong language and adult situations.*

- [City Kid](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/city-kid/), a brief *amuse-bouche* to get you into the swing of some *really* short fiction.
- [Resurrection Radio](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/resurrection-radio/), my first published fantasy tale. (Originally published in [*On Spec*](http://onspec.ca/), 2004)
- [Heat Death](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/heat-death/) — at the end of it all, a beginning. (Originally published in [Tesseracts Fourteen](http://www.edgewebsite.com/books/tess14/t14-catalog.html), 2010)
- [Seven Very Short Stories](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/seven-very-short-stories/) — what it says on the tin, as they say. Stories in 1024 *characters* or less. My personal favourite is “The Trick”; a lot of people seem to like “The Wait”.
- And in closing, something amusing — [Stop Me if You’ve Heard This One](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/stop-me-if-youve-heard-this-one/) — never published, though not for lack of trying.
