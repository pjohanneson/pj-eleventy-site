# You learn something new every day (II)

*[Part I](http://patrickjohanneson.com/2006/09/24/you-learn-something-new-every-day/) (almost entirely unrelated).*

Somehow I’ve managed to go my entire judo career — 17+ years — without trying to use Silvio’s famous<sup id="fnref-1616:1">[1](#fn-1616:1)</sup> hip-throw grip (ie, grabbing the gi at the hip, just above the belt) to perform *hane-goshi*<sup id="fnref-1616:2">[2](#fn-1616:2)</sup>, which is my favourite hip throw, if not my favourite judo technique<sup id="fnref-1616:3">[3](#fn-1616:3)</sup> bar none.

*Hane-goshi*

Tonight I tried it, and the world, suddenly, was my oyster. At least as far as *hane-goshi* was concerned.

My judo friends will know what I’m talking about. (Especially the ones that knew Silvio. Have a drink in his memory tonight, if you’re so inclined. I intend to.)
