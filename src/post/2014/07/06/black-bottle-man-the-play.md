# Black Bottle Man &#8212; the play

We attended the première of the stage version of Craig Russell’s [*Black Bottle Man*](http://patrickjohanneson.com/2010/05/06/review-black-bottle-man/). The play, like the novel, was quite enjoyable. I was impressed at how the cast almost all took on multiple roles. This was helped by the stories-within-stories framing of the play.

The story held the same heartbreak and hope the novel did. The good-vs.-evil struggle remained the core of the story; the struggle of a family–of *many* families–torn apart was just as wrenching. The translation to stage was well done.
