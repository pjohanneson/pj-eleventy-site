# Burkina Faso

This inspired a bit of reminiscence between me and a co-worker:

> Pat J: I saw Terror of Tiny Town live at SUDS  
>  Pat J: and at the Unwinder, back in the day  
>  Craig: yeah my buddy’s band opened for them at the Unwinder  
>  Pat J: really?  
>  Pat J: they changed their name like three times during their set, IIRC  
>  Pat J: started out Bitch Jihad and ended up Magnum something  
>  Pat J: or the other way around  
>  Pat J: TOTT was opening for some Canadian grunge band  
>  Pat J: after they played I left, because nothin’ was gonna top what I’d just seen and heard  
>  Pat J: not a single track on the CD I bought is a disappointment  
>  Pat J: but Burkina Faso is a favourite  
>  Craig: I need to get a tape from my buddy — not sure what band they were when they opened…  
>  Craig: Kilgore Trout maybe?  
>  Craig: but they had a side project called Forces of Destruction  
>  Craig: and they have a song called Grand Moff Tarkin  
>  Craig: and it’s great  
>  Pat J: they were Magnum Jihad at the end, Seven Year Bitch at the start  
>  Pat J: and Geoff Berner, the lead singer for TOTT, took the stage and said, “Let’s have a round of applause for, uh, Bitch Jihad, or whatever that was”  
>  Craig: haha
