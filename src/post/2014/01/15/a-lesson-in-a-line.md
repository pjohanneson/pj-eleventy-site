# A lesson in a line

Reading in bed last night, I came across this gem:

> It is always a temptation to say that such feelings are indescribable, though they seldom are.  
>  — Gene Wolfe, *The Sword of the Lictor* (vol. III in the *Book of the New Sun* tetralogy), chapter XXII: “The Skirts of the Mountain”

In a single line the author eviscerated a fairly common trope in SF/F writing. Now and forever after, when I read a sentence stating that *X was indescribable* or referring to *an indescribable colour* or *an indescribable feeling*, I’m going to wonder: Is it *really* indescribable, though, or is the author simply not interested enough to describe it to me?

I’ve taken the lesson to heart, though: from here on out I’ll be doing my best to excise *indescribable* from my own lexicon.
