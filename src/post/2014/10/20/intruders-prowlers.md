# Intruders &#038; Prowlers

Yesterday I saw this great photo of two Lego jets, the A-6 Intruder and the EA-6B Prowler:

…which reminded me of my halcyon days as an Air Cadet, attending Air Studies<sup id="fnref-1587:1">[1](#fn-1587:1)</sup> Camp in Penhold, Alberta. My Air Studies flight<sup id="fnref-1587:2">[2](#fn-1587:2)</sup> was named “Prowler Flight” for the EA-6B Prowler, which was the Electronic Warfare version of the A-6 Intruder.

Back then I didn’t think anything of the nomenclature, but now it strikes me as a little… creepy. I have to wonder, is there a plane out there code-named “Stalker”?

2. A *flight* is pretty much the Air Force equivalent of a *platoon*. [↩](#fnref-1587:2)
