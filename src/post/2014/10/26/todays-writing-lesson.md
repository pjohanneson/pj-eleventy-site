# Today&#8217;s writing lesson

…courtesy of [an io9 article about *Hellraiser*](http://io9.com/all-the-weirdest-secrets-you-never-knew-about-clive-bar-1650487166).

> \[…\] I think what the monsters in movies have to say for themselves is every bit as interesting as what the human beings have to say. That’s why in stalk and slash films I feel that half the story is missing. These creatures simply become, in a very boring way, abstractions of evil. *Evil is never abstract.* It is always concrete, always particular and always vested in individuals. To deny the creatures as individuals the right to speak, to actually state their case, is perverse—because I want to hear the Devil speak. I think that’s a British attitude. I like the idea that a point of view can be made by the dark side.

I think it’s a Canadian attitude, too. Or maybe I lean more to the British than the American point of view on such matters.

I’m not particularly fond of horror films, and so I’ve never actually seen *Hellraiser*. Now I sort of want to.
