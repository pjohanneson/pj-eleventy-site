# August Aurora

I headed out of town, hoping to catch Mars and Saturn before they set. I didn’t have a lot of time, and when I got to a decent dark spot, the view wasn’t great, and highway traffic to the south would have outshined the planets in any event.

Then I turned around, to face the north.

My disappointment faded away.
