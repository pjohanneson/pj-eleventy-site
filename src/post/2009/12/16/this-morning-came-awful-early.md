# This morning came awful early

When my wife’s alarm clock went off at 5:30 AM, she said to me, “When did you get in last night?”

Me: “3:30.”  
Her: “Yeah. I woke up at 2:30, and you weren’t in yet. I thought, *Those idiots*\*, and went back to sleep.”

*Those idiots* were me and my cow-orker Craig, and the reason we got in at 3:30 AM was that we went to the city to see Neil Gaiman last night.

A couple photos:

I’ll probaby have more to say later. Right now I have to get back to work.

\* My wife would like it pointed out that she called us *dummies*, not *idiots*.
