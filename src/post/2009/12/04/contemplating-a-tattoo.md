# Contemplating a tattoo

…someday. And so here’re the ones currently under consideration:

- Two ravens, along with a quote from verse 80 of [*Hávamál*](http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html): “Praise ice when over it”. (But ideally, translated into Icelandic.)
- [This](http://judoinfo.com/kodokan.gif) — the <strike>cherry blossom</strike> eight-sided mirror symbol of Kodokan Judo.
- *Eppur si muove* — Galileo’s (probably apocryphal) rebuttal to his forced confession that the Earth does not move. It means “And yet it *does* move.”
- “Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter”.
