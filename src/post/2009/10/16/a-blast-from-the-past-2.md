# A blast from the past

…in more ways than one.

When I was in University, there was a girl I knew that had a book called *10,000 Dreams Interpreted*\*. She pointed one out to me, and it became my favourite dream ever:

> To see a horse in human flesh, descending on a hammock through the air, and as it nears your house is metamorphosed into a man, and he approaches your door and throws something at you which seems to be rubber but turns into great bees, denotes miscarriage of hopes and useless endeavors to regain lost valuables. To see animals in human flesh, signifies great advancement to the dreamer, and new friends will be made by modest wearing of well-earned honors. If the human flesh appears diseased or freckled, the miscarriage of well-laid plans is denoted.

Little did I know — until today — that that book was first published in 1901, and that dream’s been haunting peoples’ minds ever since then.

\* Or something to that effect. Come on, this was 15+ years ago. Sometimes I have a hard time remembering where I put the cordless phone ten minutes ago.\*\*

\*\* Until it rings.
