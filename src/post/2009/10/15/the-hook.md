# The hook

> Every time your heart beats, a ghost peels away from you. Invisible, weightless, this perfect copy of the state of your mind ascends, rising into the dark of the eternal night, bound for the distant edge of spacetime and the unimaginable conflict that will inevitably arise there, someday, between entropy and hope.

How’s that for a hook? Make you want to read more?

Well, it’s the opening for my current work-in-progress, a long project (probably novel-length) titled *Once I was you*. It deals with the eventual fate of the human race, and the fates of several other civilizations far more ancient, too.

Interested? I am.
