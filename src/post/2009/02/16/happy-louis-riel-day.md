# Happy Louis Riel Day!

So Manitoba has a long weekend in February, still relatively new, called [Louis Riel Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Riel_Day), named for [the only Father of Confederation hanged for treason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Riel).

It’s a provincial holiday, not a federal one, which means the mail still comes. Which means that today, I got a package of chocolate chip cookies from my sister in Alberta.

Woo hoo, happy Louis Riel Day to me!

(If you’re interested in Louis Riel, [this graphic novel](http://www.amazon.ca/Louis-Riel-Comic-Strip-Chester-Brown/dp/1894937899/) is a pretty solid introduction.)
