# The movie deal (now with picture!)

So a friend of mine took a degree in film, and has made some short films. The other day he said, “Hey, I’d love to do a short film based on [Resurrection Radio](/fiction/read/1). How much would you want for film rights?”

I said, “Let me think on it.”

Today I gave him a figure, and he agreed.

And yes, he’s got a deal with Stephen King, and yes, I’m making more than King — by a considerable margin — but no, it’s not going to pay off the mortgage.

(Hint: The deal he’s got with King is on a [dollar baby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_Baby) story.)
