# It&#8217;s not so much what she&#8217;s saying, it&#8217;s how she&#8217;s saying it

So I’m walking over to the machine room to reboot a server, since there’s a crisis going on (people can’t log in to a website). There’s a couple sitting on the bench by the windows — cute girl, guy wearing one of those toques with strings\*. They’re having a chat, turned to more or less face one another\*\*.

As I pass, I hear her side of the conversation: “I don’t want to *be* with you anymore.”

It goes from an “awwwww” moment to an awkward one in just a millisecond. I keep walking, because I’m not sure I want to hear his response.

I leave the machine room after the server’s rebooted, and they’re already gone.

\*That’s pretty much all I noticed about him.  
\*\* As much as you can, sitting side-by-side on a wooden bench.
