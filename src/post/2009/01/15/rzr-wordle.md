# RZR wordle

<div align="center">[![](http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/441481/Resurrection_Radio)](http://www.wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/441481/Resurrection_Radio "Wordle: Resurrection Radio")</div>Apparently this is a visualization (from [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/)) of my short story [Resurrection Radio](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/read/1), mapping the 1000 most used words in the story. Larger words appear more often in the text. It seems my POV character mentions his friend Kaylaâ€™s name an awful lot.
