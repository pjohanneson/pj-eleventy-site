# My Hollow Bean costume

I don’t dress up very often for [Hollow Bean](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/2005/10/31/explain-said-the-interrogation-machine/). The last time, I think, I wore devil horns and a suit to work, and told everyone I was “Administration”.

This year, I got dressed up as a superhero.

First, the secret identity shot:

Mild-mannered nerd **J. Lloyd Dorkstick.**

And now, may I present:

**Captain Awesome.**

Please note the long johns under the swimsuit, since Canadian superheroes don’t wear tights.

Now you see why my wife laughed and laughed and laughed, until I put my pants back on.
