# Triple threat

I’m kind of a sucker for certain things:

1. Images of galaxies — I love the great whorls of stars that make up the visible mass of the Universe
2. The history of science, especially physics and astronomy
3. A clever title

So it was probably inevitable that I’d check [this book](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20127001.800-review-the-day-we-found-the-universe-by-marcia-bartusiak.html) out of the library today:

I’ll let you know what I think when I’m done reading it.
