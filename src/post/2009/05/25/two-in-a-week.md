# Two in a week

It’s bad enough when someone 15 years older than I am passes away, someone I respected and admired, someone I viewed as a mentor.

It’s worse — somehow — when someone that has the exact same birthday as I do passes away.

Sorry if you’re reading this, Mom; I’ll try to minimize the swearing in future posts. But I’ve got to get this off my chest:

Fuck you, cancer.
