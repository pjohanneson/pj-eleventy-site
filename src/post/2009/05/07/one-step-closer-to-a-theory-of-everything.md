# One step closer to a theory of everything

May 6th was McHappy Day, when McDonald’s restaurants donated a portion of sales to children’s charities.

May 5th was Cinco de Mayo, largely celebrated around these parts by going to Mexican restaurants and drinking booze that makes you think of Mexico.

**∴** if you woke up on the 6th with a horrible hangover from your Cinco tequila-and-Corona bender, needing some greasy food stat — why not go to McD’s and at least gorge on Egg McMuffins for a good cause?

Coincidence, or clever marketing by the Clown Prince of Capitalism?
