# All of a sudden

Things change in a twinkling sometimes. My judo sensei, who has had cancer for a year and a half — maybe longer, I can’t remember what year it began — died this morning at 2 AM.

I saw him on Wednesday, and he looked fine, if a little thin. Now he’s gone, and I still can’t quite believe it.
