# Comparative Gourmetology

If you’ve never had poutine — if you don’t know what poutine *is* — it’s a French Canadian food, consisting of French fries, gravy, and cheese curds.

I never thought I’d eat a food that made poutine seem light in comparison, but that’s because I’d never had a “Chicken Bake” from Costco before tonight.

Yikes. I ate less than half the thing and I still feel like I may never be able to eat again.
