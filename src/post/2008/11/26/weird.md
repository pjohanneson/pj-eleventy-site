# Weird and sad

A girl from my home town who was about, what, four or maybe five years younger than me has died. She had a heart attack, apparently.

Wow.

And I found out by the magic of Facebook groups. I donâ€™t even know what that says about the world. Are we more connected? Less?

Rest in peace.
