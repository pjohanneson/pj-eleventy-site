# Music I&#8217;m enjoying tonight

Baddd Spellah featuring [MC Frontalot](http://frontalot.com/), “Rhyme of the Nibelungs”:

> …the music’s hella stupid, it don’t got no beats  
> and that’s the twenty-second time I heard the leitmotiv  
> and I cite no grief but opera ain’t for me  
> it’s for the type of people who listen to the CBC

[Corb Lund](http://www.corblund.com/)\*, “Brother Brigham, Brother Young”:

> Now I believe your revelations, Brother Brigham, Brother Young  
> I now believe your revelations, every one  
> Even the ones beyond all reason, Brother Brigham, Brother Young  
> Even the ones beyond all reason, Brother Young

Peeping Tom, “We’re Not Alone”:

> We’re not alone in this psychodrome, and I don’t wanna lose ya  
> Our love is made like a Starbucks chain and we’re takin’ over this neighbourhood

Tragically Hip, “At the Hundredth Meridian”:

> Drivin’ down a corduroy road  
> Weeds standing shoulder-high

Barenaked Ladies, “Helicopters”:

> This is where the allies bombed the school  
> They say by mistake  
> Here nobody takes me for a fool  
> Just for a fake

Terror of Tiny Town, “Burkina Faso”:

> Mr. Thompson was overqualified  
> So he offered to poke out his extra eye  
> You should’ve seen it, it was quite a show  
> But then I had to let him go

And so it goes…
