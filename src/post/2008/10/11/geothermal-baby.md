# Geothermal baby!

Right this second, as I type this, water mixed with methyl\* alcohol is traveling out of my house, into pipes that plunge 110 feet vertically into the ground below my yard, and returning into my house. There, an expensive apparatus extracts the heat from the water and sends it back out to circulate some more.

Sweet.
