# Almost Geothermal

Right now, as I type this, there are two men making mechanical noises in my basement. Tomorrow, first thing in the morning\*, I should have heat again; sometime after the long weekend\*\* I should be pulling that heat directly from the ground.

Woohoo, and it’s about time too.

\_\_\_\_

\* Assuming the electrician shows up at 8 AM so I can let him in before I go to work.  
\*\* Sometimes it’s awesome being a Canadian. Like when I look forward to having Monday off work, because it’s Thanksgiving around here. Of course the flip side of that is that Thanksgiving is the gateway to winter.
