# Standing on guard

W00t! It’s back!

[Canadian World Domination](http://www.standingonguard.com/index2.html) has returned! Here I thought I was going to have to go trawl the wayback machine’s Internet archives, but someone’s resurrected the site for me.

Some gems:

- The redrawn world map, in the [Cartography](http://www.standingonguard.com/cartography.html) section  
  ![](http://www.standingonguard.com/images/eventualmap.gif)
- The little pull-quotes at the bottoms of all the pages, like:

- [The Generals.](http://www.standingonguard.com/generals.html) Which one is hotter? That’s up to each and every true red-blooded Canuck to decide for him- or herself.
- [“You dismiss all beers under 6% as ‘for children and the elderly’.”](http://www.standingonguard.com/toocanadian.html)

I’ll leave you with a piece of Canadian music, one that’s been stuck in my head for a couple days now, so it might as well be stuck in yours too.

*Locked in the Trunk of a Car*

And while I’m posting videos from the Tragically Hip, here’s one of my favourites:
