# Pseudo-auto-portraiture

So is it a self-portrait if you take a picture of a photo of yourself? No? Didnâ€™t think so.

At any rate:

My hair has aged 18 years since this photo was taken. So has the rest of me.

Also, by the time I got rid of that Batman shirt, it had gone heather-grey from repeated washings. That remains my favourite shirt ever.
