# Gramma J

My last remaining grandmother died last week. It was fast; she went in her sleep the night after she’d been admitted to the hospital.

I delivered the eulogy, presented here in edited form:

> Ladies, gentlemen, friends, and family:
> 
> We gather here today to mourn the loss of my Gramma, Jeanne Johanneson, but more importantly, we gather to celebrate her life.
> 
> Jeanne Olwen Gilliam was born March 24th, 19XX. Orphaned at a young age, she was raised by her aunt, Inez Kingdom, in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, Wales.
> 
> During her nurse’s training, Gramma met George Johanneson, a soldier who had been wounded during the Second World War. They were married in Sussex, England, and moved to Canada, where they lived.
> 
> (If you don’t mind, from here on out, I’m going to call them Gramma and Grampa — I don’t recall ever calling them Jeanne or George in my life.)
> 
> Gramma was an avid gardener. Mom was always impressed by–not to say a little envious of–her flowerbeds, especially her roses. I remember one year when Gramma grew a rose in such a dark purple shade it might as well have been black.
> 
> She always seemed have a pet, too. At least one. She was partial to Siamese cats for reasons I don’t think I’ll ever understand — they seemed to like her, but I never got anything from them but grief. She was also fond of Welsh Corgis — the Queen’s dogs. I remember her little dog Taffy, playing endlessly with that slobbery ball of his. I also remember Rex, the first dog of hers that I can recall.
> 
> Gramma loved her British humour — Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, Benny Hill, all the old classics. My sisters and I shared this enjoyment, though my dad doesn’t. My sisters and I would sometimes joke that maybe that particular gene skipped a generation.
> 
> A lot of my memories of Gramma centre on the Christmas season. I remember Gramma’s trifle — such a delicious dessert that I eventually learned to make my own — and what we refer to as Gramma tarts, which I’m informed are really “maid-of-honour tarts”, and the ham she’d cook. I remember the Christmas lights she had, the ones with water in them that would bubble once they’d got hot enough.
> 
> Gramma was a fan of the Royal Family, too. Sometimes it seemed like half the decorations in her house were green Wedgwood; half of what remained seemed dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and her family.
> 
> I still have the big black-and-yellow wool blanket that she bought in Wales for me when I was just a wee one. It’s great, and so-o-o-o warm.
> 
> Jeanne Johanneson has gone on ahead of us, at the age of XX. She will be missed. She will always be loved.
