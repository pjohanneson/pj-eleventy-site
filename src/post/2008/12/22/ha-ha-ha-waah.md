# Ha ha ha waah

This is not a political blog, nor will it become one, but:

[Stephen Harper appoints senators](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/22/senate-harper.html)

> “Stephen Harper keeps telling Canadians to tighten their belts,” said NDP democratic reform critic David Christopherson. “But these 18 unelected senators will cost the taxpayer over $6 million a year. When will the Conservatives start practising what they preach?”

  
[Harper appoints judge](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/22/harper-justice.html)

> Stephen Harper has officially appointed Thomas Cromwell of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, bypassing a parliamentary hearing process \[Harper\] has championed to more openly scrutinize nominees.

I suspect he did this stuff now so that [Rick Mercer](http://www.rickmercer.com/) couldn’t pounce on it.

OK, for you non-Canadians, here’s a quick reference card:

Stephen Harper is the Prime Minister of Canada. He is the leader of a minority government, which means that his party got less than 50% of the seats in Parliament, but more than any other party. (We’ve got 5 parties with seats in Parliament.) Part of his campaign, part of his essence, is Senate reform: the establishment of a Senate that’s elected, not appointed. Apparently he’s not quite so dedicated to that ideal as we all thought.

Rick Mercer is a political comedian. He has a weekly show, currently on a Christmas hiatus, wherein he rants about the foibles of the Canadian government. I can’t wait to see what he’s got to say on this topic.

The last time Harper did a volte-face on his policy, here’s what we got:

So yeah. I’m laughing at Harper, and crying too.
