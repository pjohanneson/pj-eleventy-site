# Unpleasant realization

From the front matter of Steven Brust’s [Firefly fan-fic(ish) novel](http://dreamcafe.com/firefly.html) (found via [Scalzi’s Whatever](http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=341)):

> For people who care about such things, the book was written in emacs on a box running Mandrake Linux, then I used OpenOffice to format it for printing. The final layout for online publication was created with Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat. People who care about such things need to get a life.

I got to the last sentence and thought, *Aw, that’s me*.

(Of course, when I read the *first* sentence, I thought, Good heavens, man, there’s One True text editor, and that’s *vi*. Go go gadget **:%s/\]\*&gt;//gi** .

It would seem that I’m a nerd.)
