# Everything that never ended

![](http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/images/content/Lords-Nonsuch.jpg)So I’ve been having kind of mixed feelings about my online serial novel, [*Everything that never happened*](/everything/), which has been stalled since, oh, August or so. June, if I’m honest with myself. This week I decided to push it to the back burner, and work instead on *Salyx*, which is my 2006 Nano novel. I’ve had some good ideas recently for that story, and it’s been more and more in the forefront of my writing brain, so it only seemed natural I’d get to it.

But in the last two days, two of my friends (both named John, coincidentally) have inquired about the status of *Everything etc*. One has read to the first interlude; the other has made it to chapter 8 or so. And so I’ve started to think that maybe I should push through, and get a first draft completed (which, honestly, is what this particular online novel is).

So in the next little while I’m going to try and do both. I’ve decided to try using Spacejock’s yWriter software to work on *Salyx*; I may try using it for *Everything* as well. We’ll see how this goes.

If I find I really can’t handle two writing projects at once, I guess I’ll have to choose. At this point the choice looks like it would fall to *Salyx*‘s favour, but who knows? Maybe getting in there, getting my hands dirty with those characters from the spooky, zombie-infested 17th century will rekindle my fervor for *Everything*.

I hope this post is of interest to someone other than me… but even if it ain’t, it’s something I wanted to say. Well, write. Well, type.
