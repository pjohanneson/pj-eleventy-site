# Some fiction for you

One of my recent [ficlets](http://ficlets.com/authors/pj/), one that I’m particularly proud of:

**The Trick**

> “You want to see a trick?”
> 
> Her eyes narrowed. “What kind?”
> 
> “Like nothing you’ve ever seen,” he said, and took a swig straight from the bottle. Red wine stained his teeth. “Promise.”
> 
> “All right.” She leaned back in the chair as he stood up, crossed to the centre of the room, and did some kind of odd shoulder-shrugging warmup dance. Heâ€™d left the bottle on the table, and she took it, wrapped her lips around it, and chugged what remained of the wine. She had a buzz going and wasnâ€™t about to lose it.
> 
> Without prelude, without screaming, without any warning whatsoever, he burst into flames. In perfect silence he burned, staring into her soul with those intense grey eyes he had.
> 
> She dropped the bottle. It shattered, green shards everywhere. She wanted to scream but couldn’t. She stared as he was consumed.
> 
> There was a pile of ash and a black spot on the hardwood, and no other evidence he’d ever existed.
> 
> \#
> 
> The door opened and he walked in. She leapt from the recliner, embraced him, and said, “How’d you do it?”

It’s not always easy, fitting a complete story into 1024 characters, but this time it just sort of happened.
