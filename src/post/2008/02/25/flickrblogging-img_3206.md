[IMG\_3206](http://www.flickr.com/photos/frittpalestina/406162992/)  
Discovered in [\* MAGNE](http://www.flickr.com/people/frittpalestina/)‘s Flickr photostream. </div>She said, “Just a little more helium, if you please,” and then she slipped away into the sky. Two days later she touched down in Old Dan’s meadow, ankle-deep in wildflowers and foxtail. Something had turned her eyes from drab brown to silver, the colour of sun-kissed clouds, and for her nothing was ever the same again.

She was free now, and she damn well knew it.
