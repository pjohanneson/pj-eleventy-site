# So, again, Mr. TV, we meets.

> **TV**: Coming up next on NBC: *Amnesia*, the game show that tests the memory — of *you!*  
> **Me**: Should I trust the writers of a program that couldn’t come up with a tagline that scans better, like, say, “the game show that tests *your* memory!”?

That, by the way, is a rhetorical question.
