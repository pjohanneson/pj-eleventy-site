# Google is funny

So I changed my little blog header the other day, to read “Specializing in treckle lansing disputes”. This is, if you don’t know, a nod to Vernor Vinge’s novel *A Fire Upon the Deep*, wherein a posting to the Galactic Net (also known as the Net of a Million Lies) from Arbitration Arts Corporation at Firecloud Nebula contains the following:

> Arbitration Arts specializes in treckle lansing disputes. As such, we  
> have few common business interests with natural races or Threats Group.

Now, three or four days later, when I do a Google search for “[treckle lansing](http://www.google.ca/search?q=treckle+lansing)“, this blog is the first hit. Right above all the Russian copies of *A Fire Upon the Deep* hosted, one suspects illicitly, on the web.

Well, it amused *me*, anyways.

Update, June 2021: It’s *still* the top of the search listings. Weird.
