# Writing update

I’m trying to work on a couple of projects, with some success. I’ve got a new site set up for a project I’m calling Cinder, and someday, maybe I’ll fill it up with content. Right now I’ve got a cloud of ideas, but I wanted to get the design right. Ok, I wanted to play in Photoshop and/or the GIMP.

I’m also working on a longish short story (9000 words, right now, but it may expand or contract; first drafts, you know) set in Ukraine, titled “Between Heaven and Earth”. It may be one of the darkest things I’ve ever written, and I think it may get darker before it’s done.

And I’ve still got my zombies vs. pirates story on the go, and I also want to work on my nano winner from a couple years ago.

Well, back at ‘er.
