# Nage-no-kata

…or “What I had to do for a silver medal”.

I’m the one being thrown.

Enjoy!

The throws are, in order:

Uki-otoshi (“floating drop”)  
Seoi-nage (“shoulder throw”)  
Kata-guruma (“shoulder wheel”)\*

Uki-goshi (“floating hip throw”)  
Harai-goshi (“sweeping hip throw”)  
Tsurikomi-goshi (“lifting-pulling hip throw”)

Okuri-ashi-harai (“sideways foot sweep”)  
Sasae-tsurikomi-ashi (“blocking lifting-pulling foot throw”)  
Uchi-mata (“inner thigh throw”)

Each one is performed right-handed and left-handed.

\* Which impresses everyone, but really isn’t that bad of a landing, if you know what you’re doing.
