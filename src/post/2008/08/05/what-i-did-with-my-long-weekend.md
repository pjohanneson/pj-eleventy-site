# What I did with my long weekend

Saturday my yard looked lovely, lush and green.

Then…  
  
Monday the drillers came.

And now my yard looks a little less idyllic, a little less lovely:

The drilling and the pipes are part of the “Let’s install geothermal heating and AC into the blue house” project. I’ll keep you updated as to the progress of said project.
