# Jenny, who is a dog

So a while ago I wrote two episodes in a semi-continuing series on [ficlets](http://ficlets.com/authors/pj), and tonight I wrote the third. The story is far from over — in fact, in all candor, I have no idea where it’ll wind up — but it’s been fun to write it so far.

Here it is, to date.

Jenny, who is a dog
-------------------

### Part 1

Jenny, who is a dog, came into the living room, sat down on the floor, and spoke. â€œWhat supper?â€&#157; she said, tail thumping on the hardwood.

I stared at her. â€œBeg pardon?â€&#157; I was shocked enough that I actually responded. To a dog. You see the state of mind I was in?

â€œSupper. Food. What?â€&#157;

â€œUh â€“ â€&#157; Iâ€™d been making my own dog food, these days. Jenny was old, and store-brand food wasnâ€™t doing her any favours. â€œLiver and rice, for you,â€&#157; I said. â€œI think pizza for me.â€&#157;

â€œGood. Liver good,â€&#157; she said, and trotted off to the dining room.

I went into the kitchen and got a beer out of the fridge. As I twisted the cap off, my phone rang.

â€œYâ€™ello?â€&#157;

â€œDoug?â€&#157; It was Lisa, my girlfriend. â€œUh, Doug, I didnâ€™t know who to call â€“ â€œ

â€œCalm down,â€&#157; I said. â€œDeep breaths. Whatâ€™s up?â€&#157;

â€œMr. Kit,â€&#157; she said. â€œHeâ€™s â€“ â€&#157; She couldnâ€™t go on.

â€œHeâ€™s talking?â€&#157; I said, and there was silence on the line. I knew I was right. Mr. Kit, who is a cat, was talking too.

Jenny came into the kitchen and sat on the floor. â€œJenny good dog,â€&#157; she said.

### Part 2

Jenny, who is a dog, watches entirely more TV than I do these days. She canâ€™t read, yet, but she has figured out which buttons on the remote control do what, and sheâ€™s learned to identify the voices and the theme music of the programs she likes best.

When I say she watches TV, what I mean, of course, is that she turns the TV on and listens to the programs. I asked her one time what she saw, when she stares at the screen, and she said, â€œGhosts.â€&#157; Sheâ€™s a little spooked by it, I think, and so she mainly listens. She likes the educational channels best, it seems.

I came home today to the strains of *Daily Planet*â€™s end-credit theme music, blaring. Sheâ€™d turned the volume up as high as itâ€™d go, then wandered to the kitchen to listen to the ghosts speak.

â€œLearning lots?â€&#157; I said.

â€œBullet train,â€&#157; she said. â€œInter-nash-null space station. GMO grain.â€&#157;

â€œGood,â€&#157; I said, cracking a beer. Long day.

â€œCan I have GMO grain? Supper?â€&#157;

â€œIâ€™ll see what I can do,â€&#157; I said.

â€œAnd liver. Liver good.â€&#157;

### Part 3

Jenny, who is a dog, graduated yesterday. I sat in the audience, thrilled as any parent, as she shook paws with the Chancellor of the University, took her sheepskin in her mouth, and let someone, I think the Dean of Family Law, shift the tassel from left to right on her mortarboard.

The applause was deafening.

â€œLisaâ€™s coming over tonight,â€&#157; I said, frying up beef for some chili. â€œAre you all right with her bringing Mr. Kit?â€&#157;

â€œKit good,â€&#157; said Jenny. She gets along okay with Lisaâ€™s cat. Theyâ€™re not close friends, but theyâ€™re not enemies either. Which is a good thing, since soon theyâ€™ll be living together.

â€œKit smart.â€&#157; Her tail thumped on the floor.

â€œCongratulations, Jenny,â€&#157; said Lisa. â€œI hear you were the top dog in your class.â€&#157;

â€œOnly dog.â€&#157;

â€œIt was a joke,â€&#157; said Lisa.

â€œNo,â€&#157; said Jenny. â€œIt was pun.â€&#157; She turned to Mr. Kit. â€œCome, Kit,â€&#157; she said. â€œHelp me study.â€&#157;

â€œYouâ€™re done, though,â€&#157; said Lisa. â€œArenâ€™t you?â€&#157;

â€œBar exam,â€&#157; said Jenny, and she and Mr. Kit went through the door into the living room.
