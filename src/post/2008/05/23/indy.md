# Indy

I went and saw the new Indy Jones picture-show\* tonight, and…

…well…

…it wasn’t the film I was *hoping* for, but I suppose it was the film I was *expecting*.

Too many knowing nods to the audience; too many hat-related gags, like they’re trying to work an entire trilogy’s worth into one script; too much of Shia Leboeuf\*\*—who may be a fine actor in his own right, I have no idea, but he’s not up to par with Harrison “Henry Jones Jr.” Ford; and an over-the-top climax that made me feel like they were trying to out-*everything* everything.

It almost felt like they made the movie, watched it, and said, “Needs more… *something*.” So they crammed it right full of in-jokes, winks, and armies of CG monkeys, ants, and gophers, when what it needed was more, let’s see, coherence.

*Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull*: It’s like *Raiders of the Lost Ark*, with more cowbell.

\* You know. The talky.  
\*\* I’m sure I spelled that wrong, but I’m not inclined to look it up.
