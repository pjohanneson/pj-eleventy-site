# In the hall of the awesome king

I don’t know much about classical music, but I know what I like. I’ve always liked “In the Hall of the Mountain King”\*.

Last night, I was driving home after seeing *Wanted*\*\*, I heard “In the Hall” on the radio. Then it switched to this:

It was awesome. Thanks, [Randy Bachman](http://www.cbc.ca/vinyltap/)! You made my night.

\* If ItHofMK isn’t classical music — if it is, in fact, baroque or rococo or pastiche or water-elemental music — rest assured that it is far more classical than the rest of the music I listen to.  
\*\* Don’t bother. Unless you like loud, violent revenge fantasies featuring ludicrous physics and 0.9 seconds of Angelina Jolie’s naked butt.
