# Westering, 2008

We went away last week, on the train to Edmonton. Here’s some of the stuff we did:

Celebrated K’s birthday

Visited some friends

…and their menagerie (one dog, three cats, a great huge tortoise, a bunch of turtles, and some hermit crabs)

Made a baby giggle

Built some things

Read some stories

[![C is for Cookie](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2227/2224359643_5d2bfd75cb.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/2224359643/ "C is for Cookie by Patrick Johanneson, on Flickr")  
Ate some cookies

and petted the kitty.

It was great fun, and very relaxing. But being with a three-year-old for four days taught me to have afternoon naps, and now that I’m back at work, I’m rather missing those. I need a vacation, I think.
