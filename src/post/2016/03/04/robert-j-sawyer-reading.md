# Robert J. Sawyer reading

Tonight I went to Winnipeg to the book launch for [Robert J. Sawyer](http://sfwriter.com/)‘s latest novel, *Quantum Night*. The reading was great, and the Q&amp;A session afterwards with [Struan Sinclair](http://www.quillandquire.com/review/automatic-world/) was great. Eye-opening and packed with little tidbits about the craft and the art of writing, tidbits that I’ll be mulling over for a while yet. Once I’ve had some time to process things—and sleep—I’ll return with a longer post.

For now, enjoy this photo of the author at work.
