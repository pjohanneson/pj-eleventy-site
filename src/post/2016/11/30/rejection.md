# Rejection

This morning, before breakfast, I checked my email. One of my short stories, which made it into the second round at a publication (a rarefied space that, according to their statistics, only 10% of submitted stories ever enter), had been rejected.

So I moped for about five minutes—I’d had high hopes for this one, and now they’d been dashed—then had breakfast and prepped it for another market. (Always read the submission guidelines: the second publisher wants all trace of the author’s name scrubbed from the submission, to allow blind judging.)

Moral: If you’re an author, get used to rejection. But don’t let it get you down.

As ever, Kurt Vonnegut’s simple quote applies here: *So it goes.*
