# Word-o-Mat

I just sent back the contract, “signed” electronically, so I guess I can say this now:

Six of my very short stories (ones written initially on the now-defunct Ficlets.com) are going to be published in the inaugural issue of [Word-o-Mat](http://word-o-mat.com/). They’ll be printed on pages small enough to fit in a cigarette box, and sold from a repurposed vending machine in Malmö, Sweden. (Also you’ll be able to buy copies online.)

The stories they’ll be publishing are:

1. The Wait
2. Eating Everything There Ever Was
3. The Inversion
4. The Trick
5. Dancing
6. The End of All Things

Check them out. They’re a fledgling market with an intriguing gimmick.
