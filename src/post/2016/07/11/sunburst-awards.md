# Sunburst Awards

[The Sunburst Awards shortlist has been announced.](http://sunburstaward.org/node/105) My story [“Person to Person”](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/person-to-person/) didn’t make the cut.

I’m disappointed, of course, but I can’t say I’m surprised. I was up against some very good writers.

Congratulations to all the nominees, and good luck!
