# Writing retreat, 2016 edition

For the last week of July, I left my home and invaded our friends’ cabin at Minnedosa. My goals were to get 10,000 new words written in *Translations,* along with a weekend’s worth of a flash fiction story for a contest, and try my hand at photographing the Milky Way.

Great success.

I managed to get the flash story done in the time allotted, and reviews in the forum are very positive. One day I plan to try to sell it.

I also managed to a average about 2,000 words a day from Monday to Friday, usually in two shifts of 1,000 words each. I wrote pretty much entirely on the deck. It was glorious.

I didn’t get the Milky Way. But I got this…

…so let’s call it even.

Also, I indulged in some lake kayaking, swimming, and read *The Bone Clocks* by David Mitchell, which I expect I’ll review later, once I’ve digested it a bit more.

Good times. Same time next year, I hope.
