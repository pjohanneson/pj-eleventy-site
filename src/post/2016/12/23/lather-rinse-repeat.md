# Lather; rinse; repeat

Another day, another short story rejected. ([Itâ€™s actually the same one I wrote about earlier.](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2016/11/30/rejection/))

I sighed, and then opened up [The (Submission) Grinder](http://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com) to find the next market to send it to.

Wish me luck!
