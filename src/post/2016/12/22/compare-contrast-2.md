# Compare &#038; contrast

One of my all-time favourite Christmas carols is “Ça Bergers”. (Most of my favourite carols are French, since I came up in a French immersion school. It makes it hard to find them, living as I do in a predominantly English part of Manitoba. Oh well.)

Every year I look it up on YouTube. The first year, there was one version, not a great one. It sounded like it’d been recorded in a high-school gym onto cassette, and probably was.

This year: There are plenty of choices. Here are a couple for you. (Well, for me.)

The choral version

The death metal version
-----------------------

(with altered lyrics, natch)

Which do you prefer?
