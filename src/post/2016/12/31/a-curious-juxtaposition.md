# A curious juxtaposition

Just finished registering my new toaster oven (or “mini oven” as the company would have it). On the last screen, where I’m encouraged to set a password for my new account (one more I’ll probably never sign into again), I was asked two questions:

- Do you want to receive occasional emails from the company about products and services? (No. As usual.)
- Do you own a Nespresso™ machine?

Uh…

- - - - - -

Curious as to why they’d be interested in my situation *vis-à-vis* Nespresso™, I did a quick Google search for `[company name] nespresso`. Turns out that the company makes compatible landfill-choking pods for the Nespresso™ machine.

Live and learn.
