# Municipal tax?

Oh hi Winnipeg. Just noticed this on my Rogue One ticket.

So what is the *municipal tax*? It’s not the provincial sales tax, which is 8%. This one seems to be 10%.

Also, on the topic, there’s a discrepancy between the *Ticket Total* and the *Package Total.* What’s the rest of the *package*?
