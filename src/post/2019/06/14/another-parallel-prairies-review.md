# Another Parallel Prairies review

**Update:** I’m feeling a little slow, eh, because I only just now noticed that it’s *[Amazing Stories](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/amazing)* that reviewed *Parallel Prairies*. Amazing Stories *just reviewed my writing.*

Darren Ridgley, one of the editor of *Parallel Prairies*, [just tweeted](https://twitter.com/DarrenRidgley/status/1139615499850047488) a link to [a new review of the anthology](https://amazingstories.com/2019/06/clubhouse-review-parallel-prairies-stories-of-manitoba-speculative-fiction/). It appears the reviewer enjoyed my little tale of dementia and alien visitation:

> What makes this story fun to read is Vincent’s determination to protect Charlie from the agents. \[…\] Amusing. With a tinge of sadness.
> 
> <cite>[R. Graeme Cameron](https://amazingstories.com/author/r-graeme-cameron/)</cite>

He also liked the anthology as a whole:

> This anthology features a collection of stories ranging far wider than I anticipated. There is, perhaps, a Canada-wide tendency to underestimate Manitoba. \[…\] Amazing what stories the contributors wrested from its soil. I confess this book exceeded my expectations. Well worth reading.
