# The Milky Way

I’m still learning how to process RAW images using [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) on Linux. I think I’ve found a few good tutorials, but I need more practice. I’d like to learn how to remove noise without sacrificing the sharpness, for example. (Maybe I need to shoot at lower ISO and then stack and align the photos?)

Anyway, I shot this south of Brandon on the evening of May 31st (or maybe really early on the morning of June 1st). Enjoy!
