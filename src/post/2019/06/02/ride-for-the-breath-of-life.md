# Ride for the Breath of Life

This weekend I joined the Brandon Kinsmen club in putting on the 2019 Ride for the Breath of Life, supporting the research done by [Cystic Fibrosis Canada](https://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/).

Itâ€™s a poker-derby ride, about 200km in length, with stops in Brandon, just outside Minnedosa, Sandy Lake, Rapid City, and then back to Brandon.

I was the official photographer, and so I drove the whole route, stopping every so often for some photos.
