# The Milky Way on a cloudy night

Last night was clear, at least until I got to my shooting spot, about 15 minutes south of town. Even with the clouds sliding across the sky, I still managed to get a few decent shots of the galaxy.

Photo details: 30 second exposure, ISO 400, *f*/2.8, 11mm. Shot in RAW and edited with [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) following [this tutorial from Andreas Schneider](https://blog.pixelbook.org/2018/09/night-photography-image-processing-using-darktable/). Check out the before &amp; after shots below.

As I was just starting to think about leaving, since the clouds were rolling in (and it was late and I was tired), the moon started to rise. I managed to snap this here photo of the moonglow on the bottom of the clouds, partly hidden by a hydro pole, just before the moon made its appearance.
