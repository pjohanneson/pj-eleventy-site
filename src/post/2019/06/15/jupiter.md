# Jupiter

Last weekend, as [Jupiter approached opposition](https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20190610_12_100), I went out into the backyard with my camera and tripod to see if I could get a photo of it.

Behold, Jupiter and the four Galilean moons. As near as I can work it (thanks to [this handy calculator](https://shallowsky.com/jupiter/)), weâ€™ve got (bottom-left to top-right) Io, Europa, Ganymede, and (way off to the side) Callisto. The photo was taken June 7, 2019, just before 11:15PM Central Daylight Time, if you want to check my calculations.

Photo info: 1 second exposure, 250mm, ISO 1600, *f*/5.6. Photo taken in RAW format, processed with [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/). Cropped from a larger image to show the detail.
