# RIP, Gene Wolfe

Tor is reporting the sad news that [Gene Wolfe has died](https://www.tor.com/2019/04/15/gene-wolfe-in-memoriam-1931-2019/).

> The science fiction and fantasy community has lost a beloved icon. We are extremely sad to report that author and SFWA Grand Master Gene Wolfe passed away on April 14th at age 87.

I came to Mr. Wolfe’s writing late in life. My dad had a copy of *Urth of the New Sun* but, as a teenager, I could never get into it (not realizing, then, that it was essentially book 5 of a 4-volume series). I decided he was too highbrow, too highfalutin for my tastes.

Over the years, though, writers I very much enjoyed, writers whose opinions I respected, continued to tout the virtues of Wolfe. Neil Gaiman wrote on [how to read Wolfe](https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2007/gwng0704.htm). Michael Swanwick was effusive with his praise. Wolfe, they insisted, is the writer’s writer.

So I checked the *Wizard Knight* duology out of [my local library](http://wmrl.ca/), and I found myself hooked. I chanced upon a copy of *The Fifth Head of Cerberus* at a local used bookstore, and was entranced. Later, I read *The Book of the New Sun* and its coda, *Urth of the New Sun*. This past summer I read, and loved, *Pirate Freedom*.

Gene Wolfe’s prose deserves to be read, and more, it begs to be re-read. Time, I think, for a re-read.

Rest in peace.
