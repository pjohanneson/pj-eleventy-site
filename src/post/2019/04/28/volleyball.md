# Volleyball

We went and watched my nephew’s team play some volleyball this weekend. Did you know that kicking the ball is allowed nowadays?

Also, in unrelated news, apparently I’m old now.

(Aside: I just searched [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) for “volleyball”, looking for a suitable header image, and I was frankly surprised at how many motorcycles and surfboards it turned up.)
