# 2019 Hugo Award Finalists

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized">![Hugo Award logo — a stylized rocketship](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hugo_Logo_1_300px.png)</figure></div>The 2019 Hugo awards, to presented at WorldCon, recognize excellence in speculative fiction. Congratulations and good luck to all the finalists. I’ve only read a few of the works on the list, and I’m reading a couple more.

[2019 Hugo and Retro Hugo award finalists announced](http://www.thehugoawards.org/2019/04/2019-hugo-award-1944-retro-hugo-award-finalists/)

(The Retro Hugos this year are for works that would have been eligible 75 years ago, in 1944, but no WorldCon was held that year.)
