# Shodan × 2

Two of my judo students/co-instructors graded today for their 1st degree black belts (or shodan). They did just fine.

It was an odd experience for me. They were the first two that I’ve shepherded that far. It felt like a test-by-proxy for me, as well as a test for them.

Congratulations to Neal and Joe. Welcome to the dan ranks.
