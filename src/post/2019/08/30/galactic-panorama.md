# Galactic panorama

I went out last night, since it was clear, and visited my friend Tim, who’s camping this weekend at Wasagaming. I snapped some star trails at his campsite (my battery, almost dead, managed 80 shots at 10 seconds each).

On the way home, I pulled off the highway about ½ a mile down a gravel road, and tried out a panoramic photo of the Milky Way. I set my camera up in portrait mode and shot 5 photos, 45 seconds each, tilting the camera up after each shot. The camera started out aimed at the horizon and the last shot was pointed straight up at the zenith.

I stitched the photos together using [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/), which did a very good job of automatically orienting the photos and finding the matches. I didn’t have to massage anything manually.

*Le voilà:*
