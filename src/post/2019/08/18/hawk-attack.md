# Hawk attack

So I went for a bike ride. I headed out to the countryside south and west of town, and on one of the mile roads I paused to take some photos in the “country roads” style.

I think it may have been a hawk. While I was snapping photos, two other hawks landed on a couple of nearby telephone poles and started squawking. One flew a couple passes over me. I put my camera away and rode off about another ¼ mile down the road, where I stopped for a few more photos. As I was snapping away, I heard/felt something whoosh over my head, maybe three feet above me. I looked up and one of the hawks had followed me. I snapped a couple quick pictures of him (one’s at the top of this post) and then took off again.

After that they left me alone, and I took some other photos.
