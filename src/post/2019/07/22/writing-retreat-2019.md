# Writing Retreat 2019

Last night I arrived at Minnedosa, to start the 2019 edition of my annual week-long writing retreat.

Goals this year:

- 2,000 words a day, or about 15,000 words, in the first draft of *Translations*.
  - Sub-goal: Get to the ending.
- Photos of the Milky Way.
- Photos, generally; there are a few spots I’d like to get to. The Canadian prairie is photogenic, and I want to capture that.
- Ride my bike a lot, and also go kayaking a few times. [The weather forecast](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Minnedosa-MB-7-Day-Forecast-Environment-Canada.png) seems to agree with this plan.
- Read at least a couple of the books I brought: *[Provenance](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9780316388658/ann-leckie/provenance?blnBKM=1)* by Ann Leckie (I’m about ¾ of the way through, so that should work out); *[The Buried Giant](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9780345809414/kazuo-ishiguro/buried-giant?blnBKM=1)* by Kazuo Ishiguro; *[Dreyer’s English](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9780812995701/benjamin-dreyer/dreyers-eng?blnBKM=1)* by Benjamin Dreyer; and *[The Knight](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-knight-book-one-of/9780765313485-item.html?ikwid=the+knight+gene+wolfe&ikwsec=Home&ikwidx=0)* by Gene Wolfe (because it’s a tradition, apparently, that I read Wolfe while I’m at the cabin).

I’m also due in Winnipeg for my nephew’s birthday party, which means I’ll be able to pick up the copy of Michael Swanwick’s *[The Iron Dragon’s Mother](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781250198259/michael-swanwick/iron-dragons-mother?blnBKM=1)* that I pre-ordered in (checks notes) (…these notes are illegible) February? maybe. *And* a friend is camping at Clear Lake starting mid-week, so I’ll probably go bother him for an afternoon or something.

As my darling wife is wont to say, “Write *faster*, Johanneson.”
