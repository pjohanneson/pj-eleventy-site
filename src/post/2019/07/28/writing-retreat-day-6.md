# Writing Retreat, Day 6

Saturday, I:

- wrote my 2,000 words in two stints;
- crossed the 100,000-word mark in my novel;
- debated changing the title from *Translations* to *Reflection, Translation, Invasion* (which is a not-completely-inaccurate summary of the story, at a very high level);
- turned on the air conditioning, because it was getting pretty hot;
- borrowed the neighbours’ kayak and paddled on the lake for a half-hour or so right at sunset;
- went and got some more photos of the Milky Way and (serendipitously) the Aurora Borealis.

The Milky Way ones were 45 second exposures; the Aurora photos were 30 seconds.

Here’s a quick stop-motion version of the night. An hour or so, in the dark, condensed into 8 seconds.
