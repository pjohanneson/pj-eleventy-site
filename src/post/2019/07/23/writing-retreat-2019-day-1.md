# Writing Retreat 2019, Day 1

I:

- wrote 1,000 words in the morning,
- went for a 11-km bike ride,
- visited with my landlords for the week,
- went on a scouting drive for the astrophotography,
- snapped some photos in the countryside (below),
- wrote another 1,000 words after supper,
- finished reading *Provenance* (review coming),
- went back out into the countryside and took some darker photos (above) till the moon rose and washed out the Galaxy,
- drove back to the cabin, and
- crawled into bed about 2 AM.

So far so good.
