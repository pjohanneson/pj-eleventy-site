# Writing Retreat 2019, Day 2

On Tuesday, I:

- wrote 2,000 more words in two shifts, morning and evening;
- read about ⅓ of *Dreyer’s English*, chortling all the while;
- went for a 3.5km kayak ride on the lake;
- did a quick 5km bike ride to the coffee shop and to Co-op for groceries;
- and went back out for some more astrophotography, this time in the river valley to the north.

Here’s a quick sample of the writing so far (still 1st draft):

> *Your nose is broken*, she’d said. I reached up and touched it, gingerly, expecting pain. Instead it felt cold and numb. Touching it felt like I was touching someone else’s nose. Like it was made of wax.
> 
> I felt a thin strip of metal or metal-like plastic that ran from between my eyebrows down the bridge of my nose to its tip. I tried to lift it off, to pry a nail under it, but couldn’t. It was like it was a part of me. Maybe it *was* a part of me now.
> 
> *You’ve been concussed.* *That* part I didn’t need to check to believe. I remembered the headache, the nausea that never quite went away and never quite resolved into actual vomiting. When I lay down on the bed, the room seemed to shiver and spin, slowly, an orbit that I didn’t like.

The moon rose and the fog rolled in as I was packing up my gear, about 2 AM. I was impressed by how it lay low in the field behind the car, so I snapped a quick shot of that (it’s the last one in the gallery above).

Also, my intent was to do a short video of the galaxy moving across the sky, but there was more traffic on the highway than I’d expected, and so about half the shots I took were blown out by high beams (the camera pulls in a *lot* of light to get an image of something so faint; 45 seconds of headlights (scattered in the fog that lay over the river all night) at *f*/2.8 &amp; 3200 ISO basically leaves me with a solid white image). I don’t think there are enough clean images for even a super-short video, but if I don’t go out tonight (there’s rain in the forecast), I might revisit the photos I got.

Or I might go to bed early. It was nearly 3 AM when I went to bed last night.
