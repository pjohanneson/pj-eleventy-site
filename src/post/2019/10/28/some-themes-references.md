# Some themes &#038; references

Here’s an incomplete list of the themes and references that I’m consciously including in my new short story, “Summertime in the Void” (1st draft complete, working on the 2nd draft):

- “It’s not you, it’s me”
- [Rapture eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture)
- [The Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity)
- [Arabian constellations](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2018/12/19/arabian-stars-constellations/)
- [Ecodomes](http://www.naturalbuildingblog.com/eco-dome-emergency-shelter-project/) (tangentially)
- [“Locked in the Trunk of a Car”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gOLNUJcD6E) by The Tragically Hip (one or maybe two lines specifically)
- Pills
- A line in “Road Movie to Berlin” by They Might Be Giants
- and of course [“Summertime in the Void”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAs6o-kqRDg) by I Mother Earth
