# Ottawa, Day 6

We lazed around in the morning, reading and whatnot. Around 12:30 we headed out for lunch, walking about a kilometer or so to Flora Hall Brewing, where we shared a ploughman’s lunch and had a beer apiece. It was all delicious.

Then we headed out to the airport, to pick up Susie. We took her down to the Byward Market for a birthday chocolate feast, and then wandered around a bit, being touristy. Then we headed out of town, to Kanata, where the rest of the family is staying at a hotel in preparation for Sunday’s wedding. We met up with them for snacks and drinks, and then, feeling ridiculously stuffed, we headed back downtown to our hotel.

Our vacation draws near its end, but we’re starting to feel ready for it to be done, too.
