# Ottawa, day 5

A much more relaxed day. We meet up with my aunt Veronica and uncle Marc and wandered around downtown. Kathleen found some shoes for the wedding, since her good shoes had a broken strap when she opened up her luggage; then we went down to the [Byward Market](http://byward-market.com/en/home/) again and had some chocolate at [Cacao 70](https://cacao70.com/). Marc gave a little impromptu tour, and then he and Veronica headed home.

We headed out for supper, to a place of seen on an episode of You Gotta Eat Here: [Burgers and Fries Forever](https://burgersnfriesforever.com/). It was delicious, especially the parmesan-and-herb-covered fries.

Back at the hotel, Kathleen fell pretty much instantly asleep, while I stayed up writing. I finished the first draft of a short story, which will need a lot of editing before anyone else gets to read it.

I donâ€™t think I took a single photo today.
