# First line

Since [Parallel Prairies II](https://parallelprairies.wordpress.com/) is happening, I figure I should write another short story and see if they’d like it.

Here’s the first line, written on my lunch hour today:

The working title is [“Summertime in the Void”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-F7jhWORc), for extra [Cancon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content) points.
