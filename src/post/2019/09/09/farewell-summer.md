# Farewell, summer

A friend told me once about his young son’s reaction to autumn. The boy was maybe two years old, and my friend took him out into the yard to watch the leaves fall from the trees. After a couple moments spent looking around with consternation on his face, the son picked up a double handful of leaves, held them up to his father, and said, “Fix it, Daddy!”

I feel the same, kid. I’m not ready for summer to be done, but there were yellow leaves on the deck this weekend and I had to use the space heater at the office today.

I know a lot of people who love fall, with its sweaters and the riot of colours in the trees, but to me it’s just the gateway to yet another winter. I’m definitely a spring-and-summer kind of guy.
