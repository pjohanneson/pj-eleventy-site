# The best bad news

I recently had a look at my submissions on [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/), and noticed that I’d sent “Me and the Bee” to two markets over a year ago, with no updates. I emailed the both of them, and one of them replied to me:

> Our editorial team really enjoyed your story, and we were holding onto it for a while as we figured out our plans for our next issue. Unfortunately we’re now on hiatus as we have decided to restructure our journal. I’m sorry again for this disappointing news, but I think your story is very strong and has a good chance of being accepted elsewhere.

So… it’s not accepted, but it *almost* was, I guess. So close.
