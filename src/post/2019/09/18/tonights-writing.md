# Tonight&#8217;s writing

I hammered out 1,100 words, give or take, in “Summertime in the Void”, which is a new short story about a man left behind by the Singularity.

Here’s a sample, but be kind, it’s first draft material:

> His dad, not long before he left, had told John that you can’t ever cross the same river twice, and John had asked why not and his dad had just smiled and told him “You’re smart, figure it out.”
> 
> Because the water’s never the same, he decided. Sometimes it’s swift and deep, and sometimes—like now, after a long, hot, dry summer—it was shallow, lazy, and muddy.

I’ve got about 3,900 more words to make this into a coherent story. I think I can make it work.
