# Ottawa, days 7 &#038; 8

Sunday was my cousin Chadâ€™s wedding to his new wife, Katherine. It was a lovely day, a nice brief ceremony, and a great supper and dance. It was about 1 am when we got back to the hotel and crashed.

Monday we got up and had breakfast with the family, then said our goodbyes. We did a quick tour of the Diefenbunker, the bomb shelter meant to protect the federal government in the case of nuclear war.

Then we headed to the airport, to catch our flight home.
