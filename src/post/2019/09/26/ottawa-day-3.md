# Ottawa, day 3

We got moving late, and went down to the Byward Market for a quick brunch at [Le Moulin de Provence](https://lemoulindeprovence.com/). We shared a cheese croissant, a fruit-and-custard–covered Danish, and a cookie.

After that, we headed off to the [Canadian Museum of History](https://www.historymuseum.ca/), where we spent four hours or more. I didn’t really take any photos.

(Amusing anecdote, though: The national museums in Ottawa and Gatineau have this deal where you can buy a “museum passport”: $35 for any three museums, so long as you visit them within three days. The History museum was going to be our final entry in this passport.

So, as we were crossing the bridge to Gatineau, Kathleen asked if I had my passport. I gave her A Look and said, “No,” assuming she was being funny, since we were crossing over into Quebec.

She proceeded to give me A Look as well, and I realized that, no, she meant the museum passport. “Oh,” I said, feeling a bit foolish. “Yeah, I have *that* passport.”

…OK, maybe you had to be there.)

On the way back, we stopped in at the Mill St. Brewpub and had a fantastic, and *filling*, supper. And then back to the hotel.
