# Ottawa, Day 2

This morning we went on a couple of Parliamentary tours. First we checked out the [Senate](https://sencanada.ca/en/), in their temporary location (where they’ll be for the next 10 years or so, while Centre Block is renovated).

Then we headed over and toured the West Block, where the [House of Commons](https://www.ourcommons.ca/en) will be housed for the next 10 years, in a roofed-over courtyard.

</div></div>We lunched at Café Bibliothèque in the basement of our hotel. We never managed to get there the last time we were here. It was all right.

Then we went to the [Canada Science &amp; Technology Museum](https://ingeniumcanada.org/cstm/), but I didn’t take any photos there. It was a worthwhile visit. That’s #2 of our three-museum pass. Tomorrow, I think we’ll end up at the Museum of History.
