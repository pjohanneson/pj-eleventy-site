# Bike Ride

It’s a long weekend Monday here in Canada, so I went for [a nice long bike ride](https://www.mapmyride.com/workout/3554839108) today. 23km and change, in a bit under two hours. There was quite a wind out of the east, so I’m happy with that time.

I had my camera with me, and so I snapped a couple photos: a goose landing in the river, above, and a train under the 1st Street bridge, below.
