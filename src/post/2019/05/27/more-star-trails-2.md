# More star trails

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![Star Trails](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/startrails-complete-1024x683.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/startrails-complete.jpg)</figure>You’re not getting tired of these, are you? I hope not, because I’m not planning to stop.

This one was shot in the wee hours of Friday, from about 12:10 – 1:10 AM, behind cabin 650 at [Elkhorn Resort](https://www.elkhornresort.mb.ca/). You can see the [International Space Station streaking by](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) (I saw it go overhead, too, and [I waved to the crew](https://twitter.com/pjohanneson/status/1131792809353261056)). Also, there’s a short meteor streak in the lower third, on the far right.
