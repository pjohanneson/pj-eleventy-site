# The Twilight Zone

I really want to like the new *[The Twilight Zone](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9199164/?ref_=ttep_ep6)*. But I think the problem with an anthology series is that you’re *always* starting from square one. Every episode requires an all-new round of exposition, and exposition is hard to do well.

I really don’t like the “as you know, Sally” style of expository dialogue, where characters say things to each other that they both already know, for the benefit of the audience. It sticks out like the cliché sore thumb for me.

And there’s a *lot* of it in this first season of *The Twilight Zone*.

Maybe it’ll get better, but so far I’m on the sixth episode, and it’s not been living up to my hopes.

(On the plus side, the acting has been top-notch, across all the episodes. Even the child actors have mostly impressed me.)

Update
------

Well, episode 6 — [“Six Degrees of Freedom”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9199164/?ref_=ttep_ep6) — was definitely a brighter spot, at least for me. It had some issues, sure — technical quibbles on the level of CBC’s SF attempt *[Ascension](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2015/02/11/ascension-ep-1/)*, q.v., but at least they *tried* harder. (For instance, they gave a reason, however ludicrous, that the Mars ship would have artificial gravity.) The story, though, manage to capture me and hold me till its end, even with a bit of clunky “as you know, Katherine” bits of infodump.

Seems I can forgive a bit of clunky writing if the overall story is good enough.
