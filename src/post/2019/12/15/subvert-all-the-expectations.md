# Subvert all the expectations

I came across [this well-worn but still valid piece of writing advice](https://twitter.com/MaxieZeusGod/status/1181002256814137345) on Twitter yesterday:

> If you plan on subverting \[expectations\], you need to subvert with the goal of something BETTER.

And now today, on CBC’s Sunday Edition, [they’re talking about Robert Munsch’s game-changing book *The Paper Bag Princess*](https://www.cbc.ca/radiointeractives/thesundayedition/it-does-have-a-happy-ending), which came out in that long-ago era of 1980 and subverted *all* the expectations about what a fairy tale should be.

I remember discovering (or perhaps re-discovering) *The Paper Bag Princess* in my twenties. As a young man who had heard a million fairy tales with the “and then they got married” happily-ever-after ending, it was a very different ending than I was expecting: the princess *doesn’t* marry the prince, not even after rescuing him from the dragon.

It was a different kind of ending, but still a happy ending. Maybe not so happy for the prince, but then he did nothing to earn a happy ending. It subverted the trope and made a new, better thing from it.

So go: subvert the expectations. Subvert all the expectations. Make it *better*.
