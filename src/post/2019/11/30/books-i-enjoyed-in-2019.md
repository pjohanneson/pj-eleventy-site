# Books I enjoyed in 2019

Over on Twitter, [Rosemary Mosco asked about books read and loved in the past year](https://twitter.com/RosemaryMosco/status/1200577085502369793). I took a look at my list, and here are some of the highlights of the year so far, in no discernible order:

- *This is How You Lose the Time War* by Amar el-Mohtar and Max Gladstone ([reviewed here](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2019/10/05/review-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war/))
- *Peace* by Gene Wolfe (Quite a novel, and slated for a re-read sometime in the next few years)
- *The City in the Middle of the Night* by Charlie Jane Anders (a first-contact novel unlike anything I’ve read before)
- *The Iron Dragon’s Mother* by Michael Swanwick (a fitting capstone to a frequently astonishing fantasy trilogy)
- *Son of a Trickster* and *Trickster Drift* by Eden Robinson ([reviewed here](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2019/03/03/review-son-of-a-trickster/); I cannot *wait* for volume 3 *or* the CBC series)
- *The Infinite Blacktop* by Sara Gran (the 3rd book in the Claire Dewitt series; absolutely worth it)
- *Get in Trouble*, by Kelly Link (re-read; [reviewed here](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2016/05/15/review-kelly-links-get-in-trouble/))

How was *your* year in reading?
