# A bit of excitement

I pulled up at [Chez Angela](https://chezangela.ca/) not long after a car accident. As I was preparing to leave, the ambulance pulled up and parked next to me, boxing me in, so I went back into the bakery and had a coffee to wait them out.

The cars involved are on the other side of the fire truck in the photo. I felt it would be bad form to wander around the site taking photos. Plus it was *way* warmer inside, sipping my coffee, than out in the street.

When I left, about ten minutes later, the police were still there, and two tow trucks had showed up.

As far as I could tell, no one was seriously hurt, but at least one of the vehicles was not in great shape.
