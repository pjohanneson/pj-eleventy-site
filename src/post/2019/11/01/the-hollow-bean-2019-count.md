# The Hollow Bean 2019 count

This year we had the following costumes come to the door looking for candy (and receiving *2 full-size bars* apiece, because frankly we bought more candy than we should have):

- a kid in parka and balaclava
- a knight
- a princess in a parka
- a princess in a different parka
- Maleficient, horns ‘n’ all
- a princess
- a unicorn with wings
- Elsa (I think)
- a princess asleep on her mom’s shoulder (her older sister, in the Elsa costume, collected candy for her)

…for a grand total of nine.

I should’ve given ’em all 3 bars.
