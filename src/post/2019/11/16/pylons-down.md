# Pylons down

I took this photo just outside Headingley on my way home from Winnipeg. I’m not sure if the ones lying down were felled in the Thanksgiving storm, or if they’re meant to replace weakened pylons (though I lean toward the former).

\[Update, 8 Jan. 2020\] They’re replacing the pylons, or supplementing them. The last time we went into Winnipeg, on Boxing Day, the pylons were now standing, though not yet strung with wires.
