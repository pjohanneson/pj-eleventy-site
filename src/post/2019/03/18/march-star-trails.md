# March star trails

This past Saturday, the sky was clear and the [auroral forecast](http://www.spaceweather.com/) looked promising, so I drove out to a dark spot to check out out. The aurora, if it was there at all, was a very faint smear at the extreme northern horizon. But I had bought a coffee, so I stuck around long enough to get some star trails.

The photo is about 150 images, 10 seconds each, ISO 800, *f*/2.8, 11mm, all stacked in GIMP. The waxing half-moon lit the foreground for me.
