# Review: Son of a Trickster

I read Eden Robinson’s *Son of a Trickster* this weekend.

It’s the story of sixteen-year-old Jared, who’s doing his best, trying to balance baking weed cookies, caring for his elderly neighbours, keeping his dad from losing his home, keeping his aggressive mom off his case, and generally just trying to not fail grade ten.

It’s not *real* helpful that he’s started hearing crows talking to him.

The book is propulsive and compelling. It kept me up late reading, and it made me wake up early to finish reading. The characters are brilliantly drawn, flawed, human (even the ones that aren’t *technically* human…), and the story is plainly told.

I’m looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
