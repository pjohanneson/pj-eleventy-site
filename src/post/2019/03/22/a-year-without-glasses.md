# A year without glasses

[This time last year](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2018/03/20/a-marked-improvement/), I was still wearing hard plastic eye-shields to bed, thanks to my laser eye surgery. But my vision has been 20/16 since then, and the only glasses I’ve had to wear are sunglasses and (to my wife’s evergreen amusement) reading glasses.

Thanks to Dr. Rocha and his entire crew for making my eyes better than they’ve been since, oh, grade 2 or so.
