# Aurora Awards

*This one’s for the Canadians in the crowd. Writers, SF/F fans, helpful family members…*

The Aurora Awards nominations have opened, and will be open till the 18th of May. My short story “Vincent and Charlie” is eligible for nomination, as are a myriad of other great stories both long and short. You can check out the eligibility lists at the [Prix Aurora Awards site](https://prixaurorawards.ca/) (you’ll need to be a member of the site to nominate anyone; it’s $10.00 Canadian for the year).

For those that haven’t read “Vincent and Charlie”, it’s available in the anthology [*Parallel Prairies*](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2018/04/23/parallel-prairies/), which is available from [McNally Robinson](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781773370033/darren-ridgley/parallel-prairies), [Indigo/Chapters/Coles](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/parallel-prairies-stories-of-manitoba/9781773370033-item.html?ikwid=parallel+prairies&ikwsec=Home&ikwidx=0), or (if you must) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Parallel-Praires-Darren-Ridgley/dp/1773370030/).

The story, in a nutshell, is about a retired farmer, afflicted with dementia, who happens across a crashed alien craft and rescues the pilot. This attracts the attention of some people whose attention you’d prefer not to attract.

It’s a very personal story, for me: it incorporates my grandparents’ farm, my father’s early struggles with dementia, the landscape of my schoolbus youth, and one of the little grey aliens that fascinated me thanks to a lifetime immersed in science fiction.

I’m proud of “Vincent and Charlie”. I’m happy with how it turned out. It was mentioned favourably in [Sarah Jo Kirsch’s review of the anthology for The Uniter](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2018/10/01/parallel-prairies-review/): “Johanneson finds an artful balance between suspense and sentimentality and adds a soupçon of Men in Black for good measure”.

So: I hope I’ve convinced you that my little tale of aliens and dementia might be worthy of an Aurora nomination. Thanks for reading. [And keep watching the skis. …skies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEMoQknB6WE)
