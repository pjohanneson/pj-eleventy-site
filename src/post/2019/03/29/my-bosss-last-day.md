# My boss&#8217;s last day

My boss Al is retiring and today’s his last day at work. All morning I’ve had this in my head, so I’m sharing with you.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-tm34IRP0s?feature=oembed" title="Corb Lund - Heavy and Leaving" width="500"></iframe></div></figure>The song doesn’t reflect my or, to my knowledge, Al’s views on the matter.
