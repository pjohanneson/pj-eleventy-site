# Artistic License

After two previous attempts got lost in the mail (or else lost in customs), my artistic license finally arrived sometime between last Wednesday (when we left for Edmonton) and yesterday (when I checked the mail).

If you’d like your own artistic license, the person to connect with is [Hallie Bateman](http://halliebateman.com/). Here’s the [direct link to the pre-order page](http://halliebateman.bigcartel.com/product/artistic-license-pre-order).

Owing to the problems we’ve faced trying to get this card into my hands, Hallie was kind enough to send me a couple other pieces of art: a delightful bookmark and a print of “Starry Night”.
