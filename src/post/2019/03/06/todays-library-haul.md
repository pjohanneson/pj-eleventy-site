# Today&#8217;s library haul

I can’t decide which one I want to read first. I really like Join Scalzi’s writing; I loved *Son of a Trickster* and I’m looking forward to reading more of Eden Robinson’s prose; but man, Sara Gran’s last novel ended on *such* a cliffhanger, so I’m leaning towards <cite>The Infinite Blacktop</cite>.
