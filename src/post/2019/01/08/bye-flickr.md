# Bye, Flickr

I’ve been a Flickr member since almost its inception. I signed up sometime in 2004. I’ve been there through it all, and mostly enjoyed my time.

But when the new owners (ie, SmugMug) tell me they’re going to start deleting my photos if I don’t pony up for a Pro account, well, that’s it. I’m out.

Bad move, [SmugMug](https://www.smugmug.com/together/faq).

(Aside to Mr. Pensato: I’ve been doing a bit more work on [Blinky](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2013/06/02/wordcamp-winnipeg-2/).)

PS: I’m in the process of moving my photos off Flickr and onto my own personal site (ie, this one). So I’m not going to lose sleep over the whole “your photos are getting deleted” thing. Let me know if you’re interested in the simple WordPress plugin I’ve built in order to pull my photos.
