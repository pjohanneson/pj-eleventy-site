# Green Things

For the first time in my lifetime, there are living things on the moon.

Consider: [Apollo 17, the last crewed mission to the moon, left the lunar surface in December 1972.](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo17.html) [(I was born the next year.)](https://frinkiac.com/img/S11E03/257960.jpg)

And now? [Now, right now, in January 2019, seeds have sprouted in a Chinese rover on the far side of the moon.](https://interestingengineering.com/the-first-seeds-on-the-moon-are-sprouting)
