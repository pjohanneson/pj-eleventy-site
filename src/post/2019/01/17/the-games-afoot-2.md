# The game&#8217;s afoot

A quick quote for Throwback Thursday:

> God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players, to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who wonâ€™t tell you the rules, and who *smiles all the time*.
