# Alan v. Disney

Well, this is gross.

From SFWA: [\#DisneyMustPay Alan Dean Foster](https://www.sfwa.org/2020/11/18/disney-must-pay/):

> Disney’s argument is that they have purchased the rights but not the obligations of the contract. In other words, they believe they have the right to publish work, but are not obligated to pay the writer no matter what the contract says.

I’m not a lawyer, but, uh, that doesn’t sound right to me. (Neither does Disney’s wish to have Mr. Foster sign a non-disclosure agreement before negotiations even start.)

In this David vs. Goliath fight, I’m on David’s side.
