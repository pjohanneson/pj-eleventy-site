# Hollow Bean 2020

On this windy Halloween evening in this pandemic year, I handed out candy using tongs and wearing a mask. Our Halloweeners:

- a little wee lion
- a brown bear
- an angel
- what appeared to be an Ewok in a parka
- a gangster
- a goth
- a Stormtrooper
- a crocodile
- a vampire
- a nurse
- a little wee dinosaur who told me “Habby Ween!” over and over
- a zombie
- and a princess in pyjamas

…for a total of 13.

Weirdly, that’s four more than we had *last* year. I don’t know what that might mean.

[Happy Hollow Bean. B. good.](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2005/10/31/explain-said-the-interrogation-machine/)
