# Rabbit, rabbit

I’ve only just today heard about [the superstition that saying “Rabbit rabbit” on the first day of the month brings luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_rabbit_rabbit). How long were you planning to keep this from me?

Does it count if there’s a chubby bunny chillin’ in your yard for a few hours on the 1st?
