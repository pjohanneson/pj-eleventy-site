# The light, the light

I went on campus yesterday for the first time in a month, and took a few minutes to check just how empty the Knowles Douglas/Student Union complex was. No lights were on; it was all lit, softly, by the sun.

Above is the corridor that connects the Student Union building to the KD space, where the bookstore and the coffee shop are. Below is a view of the closed coffee shop.

I snapped a few photos at a high zoom through the screen and window. I think the lines of the screen contribute to the slightly surreal look of the photo.
