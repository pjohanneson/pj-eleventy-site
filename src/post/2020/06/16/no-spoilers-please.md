# No spoilers, please

On my bike ride this afternoon, I think I figured out a thematically-satisfying scene near the end of the short story I’m working on. It involves the doctrine of true names, a lawyer, a wizard, their son, and a rather dire threat.

I’m looking forward to writing it. I’ve got a couple sections to write before I get there, but now I’ve got a target to aim for.
