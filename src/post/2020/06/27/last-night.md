# Last night

Taken on a side road just off Highway #10, about 15 minutes south of my house, at about 1:30 AM.

14 photos, each 25 seconds, 3200 ISO, 11mm, *f*/2.8. Stitched with [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/).

The video took almost an hour to shoot, and, at 10 frames per second, lasts about 10 seconds.
