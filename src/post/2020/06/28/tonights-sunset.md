# Tonight&#8217;s sunset

Today was hot. Like, “Hot enough for ya?” hot. 34°C. Thankfully, it wasn’t super humid, but it still wasn’t heat I wanted to spend any significant time in.

Then the clouds rolled in, and we had a brief thundershower. Afterwards, the light was that weird golden colour.

I just stepped outside, about ten minutes ago, to see if the storm had leached any of the heat out of the air. It’s still warm, but it’s not “Hot enough for ya?” hot anymore.

The clouds, though, were lovely. So I stepped back inside and grabbed my camera, and took the photo above.
