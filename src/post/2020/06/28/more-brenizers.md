# More Brenizers

Before it got too hot today (34°C again, with a humidex of 38), I hopped on my bike. I took it easy—it was already about 25°C at 9:30 in the morning—and I took some photos of BU.

I also took a few more [Brenizer-style panoramas](https://photographylife.com/advanced-photography-techniques-brenizer-method-panorama), as practice. One didn’t turn out, but three seemed all right. (There’s some weirdness to the pole behind the deer statue, but I’m posting it anyways.)
