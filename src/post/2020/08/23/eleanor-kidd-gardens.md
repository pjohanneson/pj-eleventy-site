# Eleanor Kidd gardens

On yesterdayâ€™s bike ride, I snapped a couple photos of the once and future Eleanor Kidd gardens, which are still full of plants but not the ones placed with care by a gardener.

Above, a tree in the concrete; below, a [Brenizer panorama](https://photographylife.com/advanced-photography-techniques-brenizer-method-panorama) (6 photos) of a gazebo full of grass.
