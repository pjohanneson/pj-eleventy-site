# Star trails, and a couple Perseids

I went to my dark spot last night from about 10:45 pm to 11:45 pm or so, and set up my camera. I was hoping to catch [a few of the Perseid meteors](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/perseids-2020-1.5678617), though I knew I was too early for the peak.

I let the camera run for about an hour (the battery actually died at about the 0:55 mark, but close enough), and the result is the star-trails photo above. I found two bright(ish) meteor trails in it, highlighted below. (The star trail image is bright because the sky was still faintly glowing with sunset light, even at 10:45, when I started; the meteors below are from later on in the process.)
