# Lightning

After this afternoon’s storm had mostly moved on, I set up my camera upstairs. In about 1500 photos, I got one good shot of lightning.

2 second exposure, ISO 100, 24mm, *f*/22 (as high as my camera would let me go), with a polarizer and a neutral-density filter on the lens.

Here’s a video, too, of about 40 minutes’ worth of storm clouds rolling through, condensed into 44 seconds or so.
