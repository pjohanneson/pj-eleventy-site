# Photos at Clear Lake

My friend Tim is camping up at Clear Lake this week, so last night after work I headed up for a visit. We had some burgers at the Boardwalk (the Jim Burger, I’m pleased to report, is pretty tasty) and then wandered around the town and beach for a bit. I had my camera and tripod, and was looking for a subject.

Someone, fortuitously, had stacked stones down at the edge of the water.
