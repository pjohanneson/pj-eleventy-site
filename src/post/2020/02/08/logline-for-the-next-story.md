# Logline for the next story

I’m working away on my library-full-of-self-erasing books, and I have a novel to finish writing, but I’ve had an idea and I want to pursue it soon. (Actually, it’s not a new idea; it’s a re-use of a concept from one of my nanowrimo projects.)

> “The Slow-Motion Apocalypse” is a “day in the life” portrait of an aging wizard who happens to be all that’s standing in the way of a nuclear blast obliterating part of Manhattan.

Interested?
