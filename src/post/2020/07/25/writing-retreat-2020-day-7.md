# Writing Retreat 2020, Day 7

Friday:

- I lay awake from about 4 am till about 5:30 am thanks to a couple of thunderstorms passing through.
- In the morning, I biked about 6 km before it got overly hot.
- While I was out on my bike, I took photos for a couple of panoramas (one of which turned out as I’d hoped).

- I read a few more chapters in *The Wizard*—as I approach the end, I’m torn between savouring it and finding out what happens next.
- I tried to come up with a coherent ending for *Daniel, Daniel, Daniel*, because while I know the final scene, I don’t have the story’s ending fully fleshed out yet. It’s a bit frustrating, frankly; I’m the kind of writer that *needs* a solid ending before I start a project. I thought I had it, but the characters are going their own ways.
- I noticed the sky had got quite colourful about 9:15 pm, and stepped outside in time to snap a photo of a lovely sunset. I only got bitten by 22 mosquitoes in the 5 minutes I was outside, too, so that’s a victory.

(And another couple dozen bug bites.)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![Comet NEOWISE and aurora](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_1283-2000-1024x682.jpg)<figcaption>Comet NEOWISE and aurora</figcaption></figure>- And I managed to catch the International Space Station as it went overhead, even though it tried to hide behind a cloud.

(No sweeter sin than air conditioning, I tell you.)
