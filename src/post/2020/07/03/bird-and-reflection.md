# A bird and a reflection

I’m not sure what the bird in the photo above is; anyone know? It’s a wading bird of some kind, spotted down on 1st Street North near the river.

[Here’s a larger version of the picture](https://i2.wp.com/patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_9240-2000.jpg), in case that helps.

**Update:** According to my sister, who I think is correct, it’s a blue heron.

Also on 1st Street North near the river: a lamppost reflected in a pool.
