# Writing Retreat 2020

Minnedosa writing goals

- Finish the last scene in “The Slow Apocalypse”, first draft
- 1,500-2,000 words a day in either *Translations* or “Dried Flowers”
- Photos of the Milky Way (possibly a video) and Comet NEOWISE
- Photos of the countryside
- Daily bike ride
- Some kayaking

The cabin doesn’t have wifi anymore, so I’m going to have to post stuff from the coffee shop. No promises of any kind of regular schedule.
