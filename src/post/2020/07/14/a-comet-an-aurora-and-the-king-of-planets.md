# A comet, an aurora, and the king of planets

Last night was nice and clear, so I grabbed my gear and drove about ten minutes west of town, hoping to catch Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE).

It was about 10:30 when I got to my spot, and the sunset was still too bright to see the comet. I noticed Jupiter on the other side of the sky, so I snapped a couple shots of it first. I’m not 100% sure, but I think I got all four Galilean moons in the shot, too.

I knew thanks to [SpaceWeather.com](https://spaceweather.com/) that a coronal mass ejection had just arrived, triggering some aurora. So I put my widest lens on my camera and snapped a few more shots.
