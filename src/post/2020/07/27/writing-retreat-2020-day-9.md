# Writing Retreat 2020, Day 9

Ah, Sunday.

- Wrote 650 words in “Dried Flowers”
- Biked another 8.75 km
- Cleaned the cabin
- Packed up
- Headed home

It’s been a great week, and if I could I’d do it all again next week. But it’s nice to see my wife again. Also apparently I need to do the day job if I want them to keep paying me.
