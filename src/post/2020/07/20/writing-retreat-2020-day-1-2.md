# Writing Retreat 2020, Day 1 &#038; 2

Saturday
--------

- Finished the final outstanding scene in “The Slow Apocalypse”, so that can sit for a couple weeks’ aging before I start editing
- Read a few chapters in *The Wizard*
- Tried to get some photos of the comet, but the clouds were in the wrong spot
- Got photos of lightning, the ISS, and Jupiter and its Galilean moons
- Discovered the coffee shop isn’t open on Sunday or Monday

</figure>Sunday
------

- Wrote two sprints in *Translations*, 2,000 words total
- Rode my bike up 16A, which is closed to vehicular traffic due to a washout, and snapped some photos
- Went for a scouting drive to Polonia, which I don’t think will be a venue for any astrophotography (but is pretty pretty all the same)
- Discovered that, just because the coffee shop is closed, doesn’t mean I can’t park next to it and use its wifi to post this
- However, not having the café’s wifi password is a bit of an impediment, so right now I’m using my phone’s data

</figure>And now I’m just hoping it won’t be quite so cloudy tonight. I’d like to get some more photos of the comet.
