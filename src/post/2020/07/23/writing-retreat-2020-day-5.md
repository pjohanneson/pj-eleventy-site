# Writing Retreat 2020, day 5

Wednesday:

- Processed photos
- Wrote 1,000 words in the morning, 1,000 in the evening
- Biked about 6½ km
- Kayaked for a bit more than ½ hour
- Read a few more chapters in *The Knight*
- Went to the coffee shop for some (relatively) high-speed internet
- Rejoiced that the forecast calls for clear skies tonight — fingers crossed for more comet action!
- Muttered to myself when the sky was, in fact, cloudy at 10pm, 11pm, and midnight
- Checked one last time in my pyjamas at 1am, and saw stars
- …and so I found a couple dark spots, snapped some more photos, and fell into bed at 3am
