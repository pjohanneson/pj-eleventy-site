# These things happen

<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://twitter.com/pjohanneson/status/1282043868515631104 </div></figure>And then I got home, and made some notes, and it turns out that the “brilliant story suggestions” introduce some more conflict, at the cost of moving a few scenes around.

No spoilers for the short story, but it a) makes my antagonist a more interesting character, b) makes my protagonist have to make a very difficult decision, and c) allows me to illuminate how the protagonist plays games with the truth.

And now, to actually *finish* this draft.
