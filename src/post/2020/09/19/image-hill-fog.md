# Image Hill; fog

Last night Kathleen suggested I check out Image Hill for some astrophotography. Since it was only five minutes’ drive from the farm, I checked it out.

I got about 25 minutes’ worth of star trails (I set my timer for 30 minutes but my camera battery had other ideas).

This morning: fog.
