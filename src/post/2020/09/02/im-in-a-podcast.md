# I&#8217;m in a podcast

Years ago I wrote a funny little flash story, called [“Stop Me If You’ve Heard This One”](https://patrickjohanneson.com/story/stop-me-if-youve-heard-this-one/), and shopped it around a bit to the few comedy/fantasy markets I could find. Nobody bit, so I shrugged and posted it here on my site.

Earlier this year, I got a message out of the blue from one of the people behind a <abbr title="Science Fiction / Fantasy / Horror">SF/F/H</abbr> podcast called Planet Raconteur. He’d stumbled across my story and was interested in adding it to their podcast. I said “Sure”.

And now it’s been posted, as [the lead story in Episode 11](https://soundcloud.com/planet-raconteur/planet-raconteur-podcast-episode-11). Enjoy!
