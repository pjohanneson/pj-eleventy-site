# Star Trails 2020 (so far)

I made a short video. Enjoy! (Nerds: There are a bunch of details below.)

-----------------

I went out to various places¹ over the last few months to take photos for star-trail compositions. Mostly I shoot with my 11-16mm lens at *f*/2.8, focused at infinity. I use [Gimp](https://gimp.org/) and the [Star Trails Compositor plugin](https://shuttertux.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/gimp-startrail-compositor-plugin-for-easy-star-trails/) to make the actual trails.

One option when using the compositor plugin is to save the intermediate files in a directory. I like to do this, because it’ll let me go back, later, and make a time-lapse video of the trails as they grow. (I use a command-line program called `mencoder` to make my timelapses, generally.)

I realized the other day: hey, I’ve got all these intermediate files, I could make a single video of all the star trails I’ve done this year.

And so I did.
