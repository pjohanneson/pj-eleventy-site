# Stargazing with the gang

I went out to Image Hill again, but this time I had a posse. My brother-in-law Cy and all three nieces at the farm decided to come with me. It was another dark, clear night, with a breeze verging on a wind.

I did about a 45-minute star trail shot (above) while they all lay on the ground and gazed at the stars. I also got a shot of the girls checking out the Milky Way.
