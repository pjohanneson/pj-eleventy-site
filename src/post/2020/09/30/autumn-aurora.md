# Autumn Aurora

[Space Weather](https://spaceweather.com/) predicted Arctic auroras (originally the storm was predicted to be stronger, but got downgraded). Sometimes that turns out, so since it was clear last night, I headed out of town for about an hour.

When I initially set up, there was nothing really happening, aurora-wise, but I decided to shoot for a while anyways. If nothing else, I’d have a half-hour star trails image. The moon was full, so I’d have a nice bright foreground, too.

At the end of my 30-minute timer, though, I looked out to the north and saw the light. The aurora had indeed shown up. I let my camera run a bit longer, till it faded back down to near-nothing.

I mean, it was a school night, after all.

(PS, I decided to make a star trail image too.)
