# Godspeed, Ron

We got a call on Thursday evening, late; later than Kathleen’s mom Mary usually calls.

My father-in-law, Ron, died suddenly on Thursday. He’d gone out to clear some broken branches out of the brush, and he didn’t come back in. Mary found him by the tractor.

We spent the weekend out at the farm. On Sunday, I went out in the yard and on the road, and took a few photos, as is my way.
