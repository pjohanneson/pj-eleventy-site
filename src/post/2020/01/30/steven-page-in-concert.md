# Steven Page in Concert

A couple nights ago we went to see Steven Page in concert at the [Westman Centennial Auditorium](http://wmca.ca/). It’s been a while; he hasn’t been to Brandon in twenty-five years. He was on tour with Craig Northey of The Odds and Kevin Fox, a cellist.

The show was amazing. I confess, I didn’t know much of Page’s newer stuff, but what I heard I liked. We ended up buying a couple CDs during the intermission, so I look forward to hearing more of his recent work.

The music was great, a nice mix of old Barenaked Ladies tunes and Page’s new work. He’s got a distinctive voice, both in his vocals and in his lyrics. His songs each tell a story, and Lord knows I’m a sucker for a story song. But the story’s not often straightforward, and deep, dark truths can be hidden in boppy, happy pop tunes.

Page, Fox, and Northey had a great rapport on the stage, too, and the banter between the three of them was comfortable, amusing, and easygoing. There wasn’t a single moment, listening to their little stories between songs, that I was impatient for the music to start. The tales told were as much a part of the experience at the songs.

Here’s my favourite of Page’s new work, at least so far: “Gravity”.

On the whole, I loved the concert. A friend of ours, at the end, said it was better than she’d expected. My wife and I disagreed: it was as great as we’d hoped.

Hopefully we don’t have to wait another twenty-five years for another encore. Eh, Steven?

\[Edited to add:\] Oh man, I forgot to mention the Sleep Country Canada/Wexit song. You’ll have to ask me about it some time.
