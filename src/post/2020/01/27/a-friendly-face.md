# A friendly face

At the coffee shop this grey Monday morning, the young woman behind me asked if I used to work at the research station. I said no, I’ve worked at the university for 25 years¹.

“You look familiar, though,” she said. “Maybe it’s just that you’ve got a friendly face.”

It’s good to know that my Monday face wasn’t a scowl.
