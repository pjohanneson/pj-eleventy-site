# Springtime star trails

Forty-some minutes worth of Earthâ€™s rotation. In the lower-left corner, you can watch the crescent moon and Venus setting; the moon is reflected, a bit, in the water that was on the field.

Nerd stuff: 153 light frames, 5 dark frames; each frame is 15 seconds, *f*/2.8, 11mm, ISO 800.
