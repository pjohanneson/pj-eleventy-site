# Workin&#8217; from home

For a while now I’ve wondered just how necessary it is for me to be on campus. I live about five minutes’ walking distance away; when I bike to work, it takes about as long to lock up my bike and walk to my office as it does for me to get to the University.

Now that [the official word is “work from home if you can”](https://www.brandonu.ca/safety/coronavirus/), I’ve got my laptop at home. Today I grabbed one of my two external monitors, too, so that I can code on one screen and view the results on another.

(Laptop wallpaper: [The Fountain of Indolence by J. M. W. Turner](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2015/02/18/the-fountain-of-indolence/); external monitor wallpaper: [my photo of the Milky Way](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2019/07/28/writing-retreat-day-6/) from summer 2019.)

Also, it turns out that a book on mythology is integral to my setup; without it, the external monitor isn’t up high enough.
