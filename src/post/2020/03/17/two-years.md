# Two years

…and I *really* don’t miss wearing glasses all day every day.

(On St. Patrick’s Day, 2018, [I got my eyes lasered into proper shape](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2018/03/20/a-marked-improvement/) by [these fine people](https://ocularcentre.com/), and went from a 20/400 prescription *in my good eye* to a 20/16 in both.)

Sometimes, when I’m feeling a little dopey in the morning, I’ll still reach for them. (And find the readers on the nightstand, and put them on, and wonder why everything’s a little blurred…)

That reminds me, though, it’s probably time to schedule an eye appointment…
