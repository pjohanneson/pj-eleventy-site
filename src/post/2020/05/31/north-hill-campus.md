# North Hill campus

I don’t recall ever being on <abbr title="Assiniboine Community College">[ACC](https://assiniboine.net/)</abbr>‘s North Hill campus since, well, since ACC took it over. On my ride today, I decided to stop in and see the sights.

The main building, pictured above, was part of the [Brandon Mental Health Centre](http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/brandonmentalhealthcentre.shtml) before the grounds were purchased by the College.

Behind that building I found a lovely little park-like space.

</figure>I was quite enamoured of the shadows in the one photo, and I can’t decide if I prefer it in colour, or in black and white. What’s your preference?
