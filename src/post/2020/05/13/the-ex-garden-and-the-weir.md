# The ex-garden and the weir

Photos from today’s bike ride: the once and perhaps future Eleanor Kidd gardens, and the weir on the river near First Street.

There’s some evidence that the city (or someone) has plans to renovate the gardens—there’s a rough road alongside the space, where before there was nothing, and some dirt piles nearby. I mostly hope something gets done. It was a lovely space, back when it was cared for. I went to a wedding there, and it was full of flowers of all colours and scents.

(The part of me that finds beauty in decay likes it how it is. Well, except maybe for the spray-painted penis on one of the pillars.)
