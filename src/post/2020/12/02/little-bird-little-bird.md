# Little bird, little bird

I had a little blue-grey friend come for a quick visit at lunchtime.

I’m no birdwatcher, but I *think* he’s [a white-breasted nuthatch](https://backyardbirdingblog.com/white-breasted-nuthatch-bird/). Please correct me if I’m wrong.

**Update**: Now with a rabbit!

Later on in the day, around coffeetime in the afternoon, I got to say “Hi” to <abbr title="short for "Hasenpfeffer"">Hoss</abbr>, who was resting in the back yard.
