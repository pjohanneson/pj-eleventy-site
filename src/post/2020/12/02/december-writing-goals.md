# December writing goals

It’s been a while since I did a “writing goals” post, but this month I have a very concrete goal, so here goes:

- Finish 1st and 2nd drafts of a short story for *Derelicts;*
- Route said story around for beta readers;
- Polish said story; and
- Submit said story.

(I keep calling it “said story” because I don’t have a title yet.)

And now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some writin’ to do.
