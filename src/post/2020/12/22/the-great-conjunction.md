It was cloudy here, but only partly cloudy, so I decided I’d take a quick run out of town with my camera equipment, to see if I could get any photos.

I stepped outside and discovered I didn’t need to go anywhere—it was visible from my driveway. So I set up there, and snapped some photos of Jupiter + Saturn in between the clouds.

Ganymede is too close to Jupiter for my lens to separate it.

The half-moon looked lovely, too, so I got some of the sunshine reflected off it, too.
