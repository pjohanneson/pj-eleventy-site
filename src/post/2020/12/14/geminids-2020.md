# Geminids 2020

The Geminids peak tonight. I went out in the countryside for about half an hour. I saw a few meteors with the naked eye, and I managed to catch a few on camera. This is the brightest one, by far, a greenish streak just above the northeastern horizon.

It was so cold my camera battery—fully charged when I left the house—lasted only 20 minutes. This particular shot was about 10 frames (2½ minutes) before the battery died.
