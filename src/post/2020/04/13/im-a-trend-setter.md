# I&#8217;m a trend-setter

My sister in Winnipeg texted me yesterday, on Easter Sunday, to show me what I’ve wrought in her household. My nephew C. took inspiration from my habit of messing with their text sign, and wants to wish one and all a HAPPER YEAST.

Below are some examples of my work over the last couple years. So… am I a bad influence, or the *best* influence?
