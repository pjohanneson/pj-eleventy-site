# An epiphany

I had an epiphany, at lunch time, about my current short story project. I have an ending, now, a nasty bull’s-eye to aim my narrative at.

What’s more, a lot of things I’d already sprinkled into the story have come into focus, especially the doctrine of [true names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name). The protagonist has a solution to his problem, but he’s so desperate to avoid it that he’s unwilling to admit it to anyone, even himself.

I wonder if I knew the ending all along, too, and didn’t want to admit it to myself.
