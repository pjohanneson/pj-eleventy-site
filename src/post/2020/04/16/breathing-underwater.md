# Breathing Underwater

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZuLsz4yPPM?feature=oembed" title="METRIC - Breathing Underwater [Official Video]" width="500"></iframe></div></figure>Listening to [Metric](https://www.ilovemetric.com/)‘s “Breathing Underwater”, I suddenly realized that one of the lines — “I can see the end / But it hasn’t happened yet” — resonates pretty hard with my current work-in-progress. Like that’s a pretty pithy encapsulation of the entire theme of the story.

Also, if you haven’t encountered Metric before, you should really check them out. I haven’t heard a song from them I haven’t loved.
