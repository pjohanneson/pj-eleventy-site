# Down by the river

I went for a short bike ride today, after I finished work: over the bridge and down to the riverbank. I managed to get a couple photos of a kayaker enjoying the weather, and I’m trying to decide which one I like better. I think I like the closer-in one, though I wish I’d focused it better. (Looking at it again, maybe I could lie and tell people I meant it to be an impressionistic image.)

</figure>(Actually, they’re both crops of the same photo.)

I also got a photo of one of the trees that died in the 2011 flood, with the new crop of willows visible behind it. That one’s at the top of this post.
