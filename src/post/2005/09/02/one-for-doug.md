# One for Doug

…or maybe Karen, his wife.

Last night I caught the last half of [The Nature of Things](http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/) on CBC. It was, specifically, [this episode](http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/show_tarantula.html), and so naturally I thought of you two. It was a fascinating show, and even in the half hour that I saw I learned a couple of things. (I didn’t realize, for instance, that the tarantula has existed for 350,000,000 years.)

I don’t see anywhere on the site where you can order copies of the episode, or transcripts, but if you’re interested, you might try emailing them from their “Contact” link. (Be aware, though, that CBC is currently experiencing a “labour disruption\*” and you might wait a while before getting a response.)

\*Or maybe the term is “employee lockout.” Guess it depends on what side of the picket line you fall. All I know for sure is that all my news now comes from BBC World Service, and September’s program lineup includes a whole lotta documentary films.
