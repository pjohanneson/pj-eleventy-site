# All right

I’m tired of waiting for .geek to recover. They’ve been down for over 168 hours now, and so…

Unfortunately, I can’t seem to get in to retrieve the stuff I’ve got in their database. I don’t have a recent dump of the stuff. So I’ve been forced to restart [Fantômes](http://142.13.24.61/~johanneson/blog/) from scratch.

The first offerings? [My first two “Gunslinger Esau” stories](http://142.13.24.61/~johanneson/blog/index.php/the-gunslinger-stories), both initially written for Fantasy challenges at [The Writers’ BBS](http://www.writersbbs.com/).

Enjoy!
