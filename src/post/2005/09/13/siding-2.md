# Siding (2)

- Siding is ordered. Should be here tomorrow or Wednesday.
- Got the whole house wrapped eight feet high in one-inch foam board. Tomorrow: the second level, I guess.

Dear BM, there’s a reason that Will Ferguson put you in *both* categories in his groundbreaking work *Bastards and Boneheads*, which, for those of you that don’t know, is a survey of Canada’s prime ministers, one which points out that every prime minister we’ve had since 1867 was either a bastard or a bonehead.

Tonight at judo: Me and X (yes, that’s her real initial) did some lazy uchi-komi, then I stretched out her arms with waki-gatame and [ude-hishigi-juji-gatame](http://judoinfo.com/jujigatame.htm). Then I came home and came within two points of getting skunked at crib by my wife and my mother.

Later, Jetsons!
