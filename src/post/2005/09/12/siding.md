# Siding

We’re re-siding the house, so I’ll probably be a little bit sparse on here.

Here’s the progress for day one:

Things I’ve learned:

– Just because the guy *says* he ordered the damn siding doesn’t mean he actually *ordered* the damn siding.  
– The Large Orange Home Store has a fine sense of irony. As I wander about, trying to find the guy who half an hour ago went to check something on the computer for me, vanishing like mist on a hot morning, the PA announced that “if you need help, just ask anyone with an orange smock. They’re there to help.” Sure. If you can *find* them, anyways.

Yeah.
