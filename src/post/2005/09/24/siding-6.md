# Siding (6)

We’re breaking for the weekend; then we’ll be in the home stretch. We’re at the point where we need the scaffolding to be fifteen feet high. The theory is that while we’re up there, we’ll put in the soffits &amp; fascia too.

My wife and I are going to the Big City this weekend. (And what’s *that* say about where I live, that a city of 600,000 or so is the Big City?) Just a break from the house, and the end of my vacation. Monday I’m back to work, so siding—for me—will be relegated to evenings, before sundown.

How’s everyone else doing?
