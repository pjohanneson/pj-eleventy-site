# After the weekend

Well, we had a good BBQ weekend. I got hooked on Monday when [Space](http://www.spacecast.com/) ran all the episodes of *Firefly* all in a row. I watched about four of them, all told, throughout the day.

There was much drinking on Sunday, and some unhappy fallout on Monday morning, but the less said about that the better.

School started today. My wife was a little harried at work last night, working as she does in the shoe section at the local iteration of the largest retail conglomerate on the planet. Shoes and stationery were not departments I’d’ve wanted to work yesterday. But she survived, and even escaped from the store relatively close to on time.

And at the university where I work, well, they were *everywhere*. Every year, the first day of classes is a little overwhelming. In the spring, when classes end, they kind of trickle away, by ones and twos and dozens, depending on when they have their last exams, etc. But in the fall, boom, one day they’re *all* there. The university goes from a population of about 400ish to 3500 in the space of a day.

I need to lie down.

But I won’t, because judo starts tonight. Wonder how many’ll show up?

**\[Later\]** Answer: seven. Me, two blackbelts, three brand-new guys, and a gent who got his black belt in Japan, from the Kodokan, but who didn’t have all his documentation, so that’s got to be sorted out…
