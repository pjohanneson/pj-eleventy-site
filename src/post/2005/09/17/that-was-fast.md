# That was fast

*Outside, Looking In* has been rejected again. [Lenox Ave.](http://www.lenoxavemag.com/) had nice things to say (“Honestly, it’s a beautifully told story”), but it didn’t quite match up with what they’re looking for. On to the next one.

Is it bad form to write a thank-you note for quick turnaround and kind comments? I hope not, ’cause I did.

Tomorrow we should be able to start putting siding on. Tomorrow.
