# The weekend

![](http://static.flickr.com/30/46954533_e1c26f5d3d_m.jpg)We went to Winnipeg this weekend. Had a lovely time. We saw *Batman Begins* at the [Imax](http://www.imaxwinnipeg.com/), went to the [museum](http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/) (my favourite display remains the [*Nonsuch*](http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/mu_nonsuch.html)), headed over to [the Forks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/46954660/), and wandered the [Bears on Broadway](http://www.bearsonbroadway.com/), which are the result of a Cancer Care Manitoba fundraiser.

I’ve got a bunch of photos on my Flickr site, [right about here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/tags/winnipeg/).

Siding: continues. Soon we’ll be done. Soon.
