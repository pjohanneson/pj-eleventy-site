# New progress

Been a while. Oops, my fault.

There’s some new ideas for *Across a Wounded Land*, including some parallels between Green’s behaviour and Leonid’s — Green doesn’t abandon Leonid, though he easily could, when the snake bites him. Thus, when Leonid has a chance to be reunited with Diana early, he chooses to go back and assist Green.

Also, there’s now a snake appearing earlier on in the tale.

I’ve been working on it while I’m off for the holidays (regrettably not as much as I should), and it’s coming along fairly well. In fact, once this post is done, I’m going back to it.

Word count: 9700 so far.
