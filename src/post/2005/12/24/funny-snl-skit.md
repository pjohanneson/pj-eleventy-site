# Funny SNL skit

…which sounds like an oxymoron, I know. I haven’t watched Saturday Night Live since, oh, forever. Sometime in the middle ’90s I gave up on them, when I realized that they really couldn’t do a skit in less than twelve minutes.

But a cow-orker sent me [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch.php?v=zLElfJ9YCh0), which has apparently become an Internet hit. Enjoy it, if you haven’t already seen it.

Note: It’s a “rap video”, so if you’re in the [I like all music but rap and opera](http://www.brunching.com/loreallmusic.html)\* camp, you have been warned.

\* Or country.
