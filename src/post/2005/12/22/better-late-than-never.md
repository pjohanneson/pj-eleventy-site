# Better late than never

…really late. Our tree is up now.

[![](http://static.flickr.com/43/76419892_0d5a7b4cf0_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/tags/xmas//)And I listened to the Christmas CD I made a few years ago, with such classics as What’s This? by Jack Skellington, Ã‡a Bergers by Some French Chick, All I Vant for Christmas is my Two Front Teeth by The Count, and about a dozen others. Having grown up in French immersion school, a lot of the carols I know are really hard to find. Ã‡a Bergers is a long-time favourite; Vive le Vent (a French version of Jingle Bells) is cheery too.

Happy holidays to all, and here’s to longer days and warmer weather.
