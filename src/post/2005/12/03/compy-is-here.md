# Compy is here

[![Kathleen and Compy](http://static.flickr.com/35/69726479_e83aa2430b_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/69726479/)Our new computer arrived yesterday. Dell had a special that we just couldn’t resist. We got a new PC *and 17″ LCD monitor* for about what we paid for our previous *computer*, which came without an OS (the new Compy has Windows XP Home onboard). Much much faster. The old machine was bought about 2000, if memory serves.

So yeah. I’ve set up the old machine upstairs in the library, with a wireless card, so I’m in geek heaven, and [my wife is happy](http://www.livejournal.com/users/justanauntie73/14828.html) because now she can actually do cool things like video chats with her sisters and their chilluns.

Laters! Off to geek out!
