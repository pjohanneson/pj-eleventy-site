# That&#8217;s a weight off

Well, I finished the first draft of a long short story / short novella I’ve been working on for about five years, if not longer. It’s probably the darkest thing I’ve written, and it clocks in at about 9,000 words.

It’s about the nature of resurrection, dog breeding, and some off-screen kinky-ass sex.

Anyone that’s interested in reading it, leave me a note.
