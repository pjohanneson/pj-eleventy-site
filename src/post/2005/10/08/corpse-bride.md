# Corpse Bride

On Thursday, we went to see Tim Burton’s latest oeuvre, *Corpse Bride*. The movie was good, but there was something missing. I enjoyed it, don’t get me wrong, but I think I may have set myself up for a fall.

See, I have a bad habit of reading about films before I see them. The reviews I’ve read for *CB* were all very positive, and so I went in with high expectations. These hopes, while not dashed, weren’t all met, either. I can’t really put my finger on what was missing, but I know that this film didn’t have the same kind of appeal for me as *The Nightmare Before Christmas* did. (As he sits there in his Nightmare T-shirt.)

Maybe it’s just that *CB* was missing the sense of zany *fun* that *Nightmare* possessed. I was looking for a quirky little comedy, and I guess I got a quirky little comedy-drama.

Oh well. Like I said, I enjoyed the film. I didn’t come out of the theatre regretting spending my money on it. It was exceptionally animated, well-written, touching, funny, heartbreaking, and on the whole a satisfying experience. Just… I don’t feel the pressing need to see it again. (Unlike, say, *Serenity*.)

**Snow**—gone.

Just in case you were worried I was snowed in, or something.
