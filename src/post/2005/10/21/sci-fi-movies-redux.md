# Sci-Fi Movies redux

So my wife went over the [list of movies](http://pjohanneson.blogspot.com/2005/10/my-first-meme.html) that [John Scalzi considers canon](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003785.html). Turns out [she’s a bigger nerd than me](http://www.livejournal.com/users/justanauntie73/12474.html). She’s seen twenty-seven of ’em, two more than I have. Hee hee!
