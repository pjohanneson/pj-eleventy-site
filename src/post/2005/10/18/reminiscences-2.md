# Reminiscences (2)

So Michaëlle Jean, our new Governor-General, is making her first official visit as the Canadian head of state\*, and she chose Manitoba, my province, as her first official destination. (“Travel Manitoba! Just like the queen-by-proxy! See the sights!”)

They welcomed her with a twenty-one-gun salute, which reminded me of an exchange I had with a friend back in my university days. He’d just finished watching a funeral scene in *Backdraft*, newly released on video, and he said to me, “Pat, when I die, I want a twenty-one-gun salute.”

**Me:** I’ll see what I can—

**Him:** Right into my coffin.

**Me:** \[amused and confused silence\]

**Him:** I’m afraid of being buried alive.

\* As she represents the Queen, she is in fact in charge of our government.
