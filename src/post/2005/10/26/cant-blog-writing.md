# Can&#8217;t blog.  Writing.

I’ve decided to enter a non-fiction contest, and I have to have the story in the mail by Nov. 1st, so I’m kind of up against a deadline. The theme of the contest is “A Memorable Voyage”; my entry, in about its second draft, is [here](http://142.13.24.61/~johanneson/blog/index.php/the-farm/). You’ll need a password, too: it’s **winnipegosis**. Read it, if you’d like; let me know what you think. (It’s short, only about 1100 words.)

I finished *Last Light of the Sun* last night. It was enjoyable, well-researched, and something that I don’t normally read. As a fantasy it was very low-key; as a historical novel it was heavily fictionalized; as an out-and-out story that happened to be set 1,000 years ago, it was excellent. Gabriele, I seem to remember that you were reading it. Do you have any comments on it? Did you finish? Did you enjoy it?Later, y’all!
