# Winter has arrived

![](http://static.flickr.com/29/49709345_da4bbf7113_m.jpg)It’s snowing today. Which is made doubly amusing by the fact that, at lunch today, my eye fell on a headline in yesterday’s paper: [Forecasters predict warmer, drier winter](http://www.brandonsun.com/story.php?story_id=5885). Nicely done, I’d say.

In the twenty minutes since I took that photo, the garden has turned completely white. No wonder we’ve got a Heavy Snowfall Warning from Environment Canada.

Oh well, time to bundle up and go back to work.
