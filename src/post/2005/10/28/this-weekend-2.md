# This weekend

Judo tournament Saturday. I won’t be competing; I wasn’t at class for essentially the month of September, due to The Siding Project, and I’ve also still got enough of a cold to affect my breathing a little. (Not enough that I notice in day-to-day life, but it’s important to breathe properly when you’ve got 220 pounds of opponent on your ribcage in *osae-komi*\*.)

We’ll be moving mats today after work, and then setting up the gym. Whee!
