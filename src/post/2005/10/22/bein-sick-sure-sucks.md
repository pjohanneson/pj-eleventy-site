# Bein&#8217; sick sure sucks

Head cold. I spent the day on the couch, essentially, alternating short naps with playing *Abe’s Oddysee* and watching a couple episodes of *Firefly*. The Western vibe of the latter makes me want to say things like “Bein’ sick powerful sucks”, but I’ll try to restrain myself.

And now I have to go to the [Evans](http://www.filmfest.mb.ca/), to show the early show ([My Summer of Love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382189/combined), it’s called).

What are you doing\* for the weekend?
