# Serenity

We saw *Serenity* on the weekend. [I’ve seen a few episodes of *Firefly*](http://pjohanneson.blogspot.com/2005/09/after-weekend.html), and I quite enjoyed the way the film extended the series and gave closure on a couple of things. We went with a few friends who *hadn’t* seen *Firefly*, and they all enjoyed the movie immensely as well. Viewed as a piece of the whole *Firefly* universe, the movie succeeds very well. Viewed simply as a science-fiction movie, it also succeeds very well.

*Serenity* the ship gave me the same kind of feelings as the *Millenium Falcon* did in the *Star Wars* trilogy, and it should—she’s a beat-up old hulk held together by chewing gum, baling twine, and the combined spirit of her crew. Said crew is at the fringe of society, doing jobs that at best skirt the edges of the law, and usually are flat-out illegal.

There’s a scene, too, in the movie, where the captain (Malcolm “Mal” Reynolds) is essentially telling his crew that they can either follow his orders or die where they stand, that very much put me in mind of Roland Deschain, the archetypal gunslinger in Stephen King’s *Dark Tower* saga. There was a core of iron to him, in that moment, that I found very powerful.

If you’re at all interested in SF movies, I highly recommend that you go see *Serenity*. I suspect I’ll be going to see it again.
