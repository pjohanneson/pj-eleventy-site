# An Early Draft

For those that’re interested, click the title to see the [13,000-ish word novella](http://www.writersbbs.com/members/vodou/silenthomestead.html) that I’m expanding into my “snowflake” novel *Earth Fleet*. The text at the link is about half the basis for Part I.

It’s very rough draft, and the ending really isn’t what I wanted, and there’s probably going to be some confusing parts, and I’m not really selling it very well, now am I? But if you want a sneak peek at some of the characters and situations of *Earth Fleet*, that’s the place to look.
