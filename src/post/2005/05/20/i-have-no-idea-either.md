# I have no idea either.

I’d say “now I’ve seen everything”, but every day on the Internet teaches me that you can never really say that and mean it: [Crying While Eating](http://cryingwhileeating.com/).

Seriously, Pom-Pom, I’m about to pee my pants. « A shiny new nickel\* to whoever can tell me who said *that*.
