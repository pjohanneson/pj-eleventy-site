# O Discordia!

My computer crapped out last night. My hard drive no longer seems to recognize sector 0, which means it’s non-bootable. I hold out hope that I can at least retrieve files off of it.

It might still be on warranty, but I’m not holding my breath on that one.

Fortunately, I have most of my writing on a USB memory stick. All but the last week or so.

Still. Dammit.

On the plus side, I have a spiffy new MP3 player that my darling wife bought me last night…
