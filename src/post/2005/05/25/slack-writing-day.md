# Slack writing day

I should’ve done more, I know it. But I ended up blanking out in front of the tube, playing *Crash Bandicoot*. At least I wound up getting a couple gems.

I *did* “flake out” a half-dozen more scene snippets, though. Sometimes it flows, and sometimes it stops, and hopefully it’ll flow more tomorrow and tomorrow.
