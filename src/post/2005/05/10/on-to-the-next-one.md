# On to the next one

Submitted “Outside, Looking In” to Asimov’s Science Fiction last night. I waffled a bit, but the guidelines said that “borderline fantasy” is ok. I think my story kind of squats on that borderline.

Five weeks is their stated response-time guesstimate. So… June 13th-ish.

Wish me luck!
