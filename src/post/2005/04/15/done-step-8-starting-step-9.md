# Done step 8; starting step 9

So now I have the list of scenes / chapters (87 in total — apparently part I has the most chapters in it…), and now I get to write the “scene expansion”. Then the first draft.

Lookin’ forward to it. And I’m still excited by this story, which is a good sign, I think.
