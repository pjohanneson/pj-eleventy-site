# Rejected again.  Damn.

From the rejection letter:

> Thank you for submitting “Outside, Looking In” to Strange Horizons, but we’ve decided not to accept it for publication. This is an intriguing and poetically written piece; we all liked it (I felt the story really hit its stride at the point when the protagonist showed up on Earth). But overall it didn’t really hold together for us.

At least they liked it enough to give me positive feedback, and not a “Please quit sending us stuff” letter like Snoopy always seems to get.

On to the next one. F&amp;SF, probably.

**later**  
Or maybe ASF, or something along those lines. I was thinking of a different story, one that’s more definitely on the Fantasy side of the curtain (“Fimbulvetr”, if you’re interested).
