# All right, here&#8217;s the scoop

[Doug](http://dshoffman.blogspot.com/) has convinced me to try [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org/)\* again this year. I’m starting three and a half days late, but that’s ok, because I’m not sure I’m shooting for 50k this year. The story I’ll be working on—”Salyx”—has a novella feel to it, so I will be happy if I hit 20k words. Still. If I can *make* 50k, I won’t complain. We’ll see how it develops.

Anyways. Starting… now, don’t expect much blogging out of me. Just so’s you know.
