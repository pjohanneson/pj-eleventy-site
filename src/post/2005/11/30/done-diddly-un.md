# Done-diddly-un

**I “won” [Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org/)!**

I’ve got good ol’ Rob in the CD player right now, and here’s the lyrics that were playing as my Winner icon came up:

> knock it nice  
> and smooth  
> step back and  
> watch it flow yeah
> 
> never gonna stop me  
> never gonna stop  
> never gonna stop me  
> never gonna stop
> 
> scream if you want it  
> ’cause I want more

â€”Rob Zombie, “Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)”

And I didn’t even have to put in a “Screw Flanders”, as per my Simpsons-addicted buddy, the B-man.

Now that I’ve crossed the 50,000-word mark (!), I guess I’d better finish the story itself. I’m probably 1,000 to 2,000 words from the ending.

[It’s called *Salyx*](http://142.13.24.61/~johanneson/blog/index.php/nano), if you wants to read it.
