# More Snowflake

Done sections 1-6 so far, which means I now have a nice, solid, 4&amp;frac12;-page synopsis of the action. It seems to be relatively coherent. Next time I do nano, I’ll spend October doing this, I think.

(Assuming that I ever need to do nano again. I’m hoping to end up with something publishable, salable, when all this is done.)
