# Snug harbor

So the Shuttle is down safely. I can’t help feeling that the media are somehow subtly disappointed. Tragedy seems to be “better” news than joy…

I did a few hundred words in my NiP last night. Not anywhere near as many as I’d’ve liked to, though. It just wasn’t flowin’. Hopefully it’ll be better tonight; I’m done one chapter and on to the next one.
