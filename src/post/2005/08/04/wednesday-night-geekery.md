# Wednesday Night Geekery

First off: &lt;geek&gt;Duh. `chmod`.&lt;/geek&gt;

Sorry. I was struggling with a PHP script that was supposed to upload an image to a server. It would upload fine, but then it wouldn’t allow me to copy the file from the temporary location to the location where I wanted it. It was throwing an error related to permissions. Tonight I got the bright idea to set the directory’s permissions (using the delightfully arcane \*nix command `chmod`, for **ch**ange **mod**e) so that the directory’s owner and group had write permissions. Boy howdy, whattayaknow, it worked.

Sorry, that’s still a little geeky, isn’t it.

Well, it’s things like that that have taken up the last couple hours of my life. `chmod` this, track down that missing `}`, try to figure out if I’ve closed all my open brackets (not that PHP will leave me guessing, no, it’ll throw errors quite happily).

But now, I think, most of the hard part is done. There’s one more major section to do, and I hope I can get it done this week sometime. Then I can get back to work on my NiP. (After I crit the entries in Keith’s SF challenge, that is.)

Everybody havin’ fun out there?
