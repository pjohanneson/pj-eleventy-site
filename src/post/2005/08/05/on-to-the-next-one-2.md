# on to the next one

Rejected. Again. F&amp;SF doesn’t want [“Outside, Looking In”](http://pjohanneson.dotgeek.org/blog/index.php/13). So… who’s next? Perhaps I’ll shoot for Interzone. (Actually, I think I will.)

I’ll post more later this weekend. I have family in town, so I should hang out with them.
