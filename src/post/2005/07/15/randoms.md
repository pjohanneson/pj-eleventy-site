# Randoms

I’ve got family coming to town this weekend, so to all my Constant Readers, don’t fret if I don’t post much. (Not that it’ll be easy to tell, but I’m trying to get in a minimum of one post every other day.)

Also, I have a friend with a wood stove and a truck who’s willing to take my felled tree for firewood. Now I just have to cut it down small enough that I can lift it…

Later!
