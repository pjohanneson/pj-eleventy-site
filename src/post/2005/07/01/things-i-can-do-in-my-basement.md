# Things I can do in my basement

- Sprinkle rice seeds and develop a paddy
- Set up a mosquito farm
- Set up a *dragonfly* farm
- Get some wee, twee waterskis, one of those tin-toy boats that run on baking soda and vinegar, and lay out a little waterski course for small insects (I could even put little Herb/Fishy/Gaspode, the betta fish, into the water as a shark hazard, and re-create the Jump the Shark moment from Happy Days)
- Sigh, put on the rubber boots, and swish some more water into my sump pump hole

Yep, ladies and germs, I’ve got water in the basement. Ground’s freakin’ saturated around here, and so it’s got nowhere to go. And then yesterday it rained. All day, all night, somewhere about 50 mm (2 inches to you Yanks). Better than the 150 mm they were threatening, but still.

So we’ve been in the basement a lot these past few days. Not thrilled. But then I turn on the TV, and see the folks in Alberta and Saskatchewan with sandbags around their houses, and water so deep in the basement that hipwaders won’t help, and I think, It could be worse.

But it could be *better*, too.

Oh well. These things happen. Someday I’ll look back and laugh.

Not today, though, and probably not tomorrow.

So. How’s everyone’s day been?
