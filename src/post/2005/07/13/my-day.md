# My day

Went to the bank today to finalize the loan we’re getting to re-side the house. Likely some of the money will end up in the basement, too; we’ve got some mold in some of the drywall, and so that’ll have to be rectified.

Did some writing tonight while the laundry was running. There’s a [“Clichés in SF”](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003471.html) special issue coming up of Subterranean Press, and I had an interesting idea today involving a Mad Scientist, so I got about 400 words down. Snippet:

> The eyes, Schulz mused, drew you in. They were Rasputin eyes, dark holes into the man’s dark soul. The face was rugged, handsome in a three-days’-growth kind of way, reminding her of a college roommate’s boyfriend.
> 
> The black-and-white photo was a blowup off a government ID, expanded slightly more than it should have been. Jagged square pixellations distracted you, making it difficult to see the face in full. Forest for the trees.
> 
> The folder next to the photo was as thick as the Sunday Times. LEDBECKER, M. was printed on it in a font meant to suggest an outmoded impact typewriter. A succession of white stickers were below the name, labeled <s>Part 1 of 2</s>, <s>Part 1 of 3</s>, and <s>Part 1 of 4</s>. Someone—Schulz suspected it was Lipton—had scrawled *Part 1 of a continuing saga* in red felt-tip under the labels.

Then I did some work on a PHP project that is coming up due. &lt;geek&gt;I hadn’t realized that it’s not necessary to do a `mysql_close()` when working with a MySQL DB. Learn something new every day.&lt;/geek&gt;

And now I’m off to pick up the wife from work, and find out how *her* day went.

How’d everybody else’s day go?
