# Notes from Friday

**Reading**

- *[Accelerando](http://www.accelerando.org/)*: 11%.
- *Harry Potter*: partway through Chapter 4 (I think).

**Blogging**—I’ve started another blog, too, one that I intend to use largely for my fiction at this point. If you want to see it, it’s [right over here](http://pjohanneson.dotgeek.org/blog/). It’s using a software package called [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/), PHP/MySQL based, and so I’ll probably be fiddling with it on and off.

**Writing**—I’ve done a bit of work on “The Ash of Memory”, a little more on my SF Challenge story, and not a lot else. Done some cogitatin’ on *Earth Fleet*, and some on *The Coldest War*, but nothing that’s made it into any files yet. I’m hoping to do some tonight, but we’ll see what else goes on.

**Day Job**—So this Tuesday I get to move. My office is being taken over by another department, and so I’m going to wind up, more-or-less temporarily, in a former film storage room in the University library. It’s kind of cool, actually; when you hit the light switch, the fluorescents all come on with that *clunk* sound that I associate with old factories, and there’s a water fountain, washroom, mop room, and dumbwaiter all in the room. (Not that I think we’ll be riding the dumbwaiter up and down, but you gotta admit, that’d be cool.) I’ll be losing my nice big desk—it’s a little unwieldy to move, honestly—but I’ll be gaining… I’m not sure *what* I’ll be gaining. But at least I won’t be moving back into the basement.
