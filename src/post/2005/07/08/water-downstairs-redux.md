# Water downstairs, redux

I keep telling myself it could be worse, but when you see that sheen of water on the basement floor, you wonder how.

Then you turn on the news and you see London getting bombed\* and hurricanes hitting far poorer countries, and you go, “Oh.”

But we lost a tree last night. Pictures coming soon. (Like once they’re developed. (Yes, I’m *that* primitive.))

\*No, not again. Not that I know of, anyway.
