# So here&#8217;s the way it is

In the town where I live, we normally get about 70mm (almost 3″) of rain in the month of June. This June, according to Environment Canada, we got 280mm (about 11″), no lie. So the ground’s *already* freakin’ saturated.

Last night, in a little more than two hours, we got (you sitting down?) *another* 71.2mm. So in, say, 150 minutes, we got *thirty days’* worth of precipitation. Flood city. Apparently there were cars in the Wal\*Mart lot that were *windows-deep* in water at one point. People kayaking down 34th Street. Seriously.

So it’s little surprise that I have water in my basement again.

At least my street has a fairly noticeable slope, so there wasn’t any kind of accumulation trying to sweep my car away. But still.

Pictures tomorrow. Honest.

(Bored? Sorry. I’m a Canadian. That means I talk about the weather. Incessantly. Eh.)
