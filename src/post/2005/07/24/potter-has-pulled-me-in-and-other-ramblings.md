# Potter has pulled me in, and other ramblings

—I’ve been reading *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* for the last few days, and today I suddenly realized that I’m halfway done. I must admit, J. K. Rowling knows how to keep my interest. Things are moving along, and it’s kind of fun to see if I can correctly guess what’s coming.

—The B-man and I chainsawed the fallen tree into liftable chunks last night. I have a friend that has a woodstove and a truck, and she’s agreed to take the logs off my hands. I’ll email her Monday; she works at the University too, at least for the summer.

—I’ve started thinking again about doing a bonsai. I did some Googling today, and found [CrashBonsai](http://www.crashbonsai.com/). Like I said before, I can never say “I’ve seen everything” and truly *mean* it.

—Today’s been kind of a lazy day; I’ve had a headache on and off for most of the day. Nothing major, but it’s kept me from wanting to do a whole lot. My wife’s been kicking my hind end at a video game, and later on the B-man and his wife (whose first initial is also B) will be comin’ over for BBQ chicken, and probably a round of canasta. Wish me luck!
