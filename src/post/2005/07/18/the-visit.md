# The Visit

So my sister, her husband, and their two boys (aged five-years-less-a-week and two) came to visit this weekend. We had fun. We read, we played video games, we went down to the mall, etc etc. I got to break out my Lego and build some cool stuff. (I’m known as the Lego uncle; I still get the occasional set for Christmas or birthday gifts, and it’s only recently that we’ve stopped giving the nephews Lego for their gifts, as they have enough for now. (As if there’s such a thing as *enough* Lego.))

So yeah. More posts to come. Things are going fairly well around here.

G’night!
