# Quickie

Just a short one tonight. I spent the evening working on PHP — apparently my free PHP host has some non-standard permissions set, which means that my image upload script fails at the last moment. I’ll have to find out what kind of permissions magic I can do with PHP, but that’ll be tomorrow, I think.

I also posted the rest of what I’ve done on [“The Ash of Memory”](http://pjohanneson.dotgeek.org/blog/index.php/bardo/) to my writing blog, so if you’re interested, have a gander. The password is **bardo**.

Tomorrow (hopefully): the spookiness of a ghost-town Wal-Mart.

G’night!
