# Canada Post and Library Books

So I was listening to [CBC Radio](http://www.cbc.ca/) today, and heard a tidbit on the news that made my jaw drop. Apparently [Canada Post](http://www.canadapost.ca/) wants to hike their Library Book Rate, which currently sits (if I’m reading [this](http://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/CPCPrices-e.asp#i33b) right) between about 81¢ and $1.74 (plus a weight charge), to—sitting down?—*$14.00*. That’s roughly a 1000% increase. Madness, I tells ya.

[**Found a link to the story**](http://winnipeg.cbc.ca/regional/servlet/View?filename=mb_library-fees-20050718)

This would be disastrous to the small libraries in the countryside, which are usually running on a shoestring budget at the best of times. I worked in [one](http://www.steroselibrary.com/)\*, one summer, and I put through a *lot* of interlibrary loans (ILLs). Hell, I put through a lot for *me*. The collection just wasn’t big enough, and the acquisitions budget was not nearly large enough either. I was a voracious reader (and still am), and ILL was a blessing for me. The nearest halfway-decent\*\* bookstore was half an hour away, and the nearest *good* bookstore was two hours away at highway speeds. And this, mind you, was before the Web *existed*, never mind became a household item, a staple of daily life much like television or radio.

Now that I live in the province’s [second-largest city](http://www.brandon.com/tourism/default.html) (with a burgeoning population somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000), I still have cause to take advantage of ILL. I don’t do it as often, but I’ve ordered books that were only available in Winnipeg’s collection, and I seem to recall one coming in from Thunder Bay once.

So I’ll be sending an email to Canada Post, letting them know what I think of this proposed rate hike. But rather than go off half-cocked, based on what I heard on the radio (<strike>and can’t yet find on CBC’s website</strike> ^^^see above^^^), I’ll do some more research, compose my thoughts, and write something coherent and thoughtful. If you’re Canadian, and give a rat’s ass about the accessibility of reading materials, I suggest you do the same. No, strike that; I *urge* you to do your research, and if I’m not totally off base here, write a missive of your own, and let Canada Post know that their idea sucks hard.

In a little protest of my own, I went to my local library today, and took out two books: *Going Postal* by Terry Pratchett, and *Chateau d’If* by Jack Vance. The former was a pleasant surprise to find on the shelves; as for the latter, well, my writing has been compared once or twice to Jack Vance (Scott, I seem to remember you saying that), so I might as well see if I’m close.

Wow, that was windy. I’m exhausted. Time to do some PHP coding…

\* Wow, they’ve got a website now. When I worked there, the head librarian was such a technophobe that she wouldn’t even consider bringing a *computer* into the library.  
\*\* To stretch a definition.
