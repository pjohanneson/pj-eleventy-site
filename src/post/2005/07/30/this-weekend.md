# This weekend

It’s a long weekend, and good thing too. I have a wedding to attend, a wedding to skip (sorry, Glen &amp; Katie), and a family reunion to attend in a town 2&amp;frac12; hours from here, the town where my parents both grew up. So… don’t expect to hear much from me for the next few days.

We bought a digital camera yesterday, too. So now we’re firmly in the 21st century, almost.
