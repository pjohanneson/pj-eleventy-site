# Hallowe&#8217;en Tally 2021

OK, it’s 10 pm and I’m turning off the light. I guess the rest of these chocolate bars are our delicious problem.

The List:

- 2 goth teens
- 2 witches
- 1 Wheat King
- 1 strawberry
- 1 jack-o-lantern, very excited that we were handing out full-size chocolate bars
- 1 skeleton

…for a total of 8, which I think is our lowest count in 22 years of living here.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I think there might be a Coffee Crisp with my name on it.
