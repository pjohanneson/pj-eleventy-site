# A colourful day

Today was Kathleen’s birthday. I ordered up a flocking from the local Kinsmen club, and so this morning, before dawn, two dozen plastic pink flamingos showed up on my lawn.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">[![Pink flamingos on the lawn](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_9620-2000-1024x682.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_9620-2000.jpg)<figcaption>In the chill of January, a burst of ludicrous tropical pink.</figcaption></figure>Then, tonight, my phone buzzed: there was a strong possibility of aurora. So I grabbed my gear and drove out of town, where I found it was cold and very bright under a nearly-full moon. There was indeed aurora, right at the edge of vision, but the moon washed it out quite a bit.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I think I might need a hot chocolate.
