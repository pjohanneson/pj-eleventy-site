# Half-moon

There’s half a moon in the sky tonight. I snapped some quick photos from my deck. It’s a bit chilly so I didn’t spend much time out there.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">[![The half-moon](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_9580-2000-1024x683.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_9580-2000.jpg)</figure>Nerdy details: 1/100 second exposure, ISO 100, 250mm, *f*/5.6, handheld. Photo was cropped and the colours tweaked a little bit in GIMP.
