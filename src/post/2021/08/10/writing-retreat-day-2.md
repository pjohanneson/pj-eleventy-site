# Writing Retreat, day 2

I woke up thinking I heard hail. It turned out to be only rain—at times heavy rain—but almost every cabin around here has a metal roof, which amplifies that kind of thing.

No bike ride and no kayak trip. I wisely forgot to pack a raincoat for my retreat here, so that was *great* planning on my part.

- More development on the “Praise the Torch When ‘Tis Burned” outline—the story is firming up in my mind, at least, and that’s a good feeling
- Rewrote the bulk of a scene between the POV wizard and his lawyer wife, sippin’ Welsh whiskey in a restaurant called Swansea, in “The Slow Apocalypse”
- Watched a couple episodes of *Firefly*
- Tried to get some photos of the rain; the only one I liked is above (it’s been a while since I saw water beading on a telephone line)

Some of the thunder was pretty exciting—shake-the-cabin exciting—but I couldn’t get a good angle to set up and try to get some lightning photos. Oh well, can’t win every time.
