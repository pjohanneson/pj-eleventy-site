# Writing Retreat, Day One

In my first full day at the cabin, I:

- Worked on the outline for “Praise the Torch When ‘Tis Burned” (aka the “ghosts in a derelict starship” story)
- Went for a bike ride, snapped a few photos (one of which I liked—the “On Reflection” below)
- Stopped in at the store for a couple of groceries that I forgot
- Decided, on seeing how many people in the store were maskless—including at least one employee—that I’m going to make do with what I’ve got for as long as I can
- Went for a drive to check out a possible photo site discovered by my friend Tim
- Met up with Tim in Sandy Lake for a physically-distanced chin-wag on the sidewalk
- Worked some more on the “Torch” outline
- Realized at about 10:15 pm that 
  1. I didn’t have enough fuel to get me to the photo site I’d checked out earlier and back, and
  2. all the gas stations in my vicinity were closed
- Watched an episode of *Firefly*
- Checked the sky just before midnight—nice and dark and clear—then looked up “[Dark Sky Sites Near Me](https://www.darkskymap.com/nightSkyBrightness)“
- Decided to check out a fairly close site, about fifteen minutes’ drive from the cabin
- Got the header photo (and a couple others)
- Returned to the cabin at 1:30am and dropped into bed.
