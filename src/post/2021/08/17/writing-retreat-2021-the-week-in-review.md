# Writing Retreat 2021: The week in review

Last week I was at a rented cabin up at Minnedosa, writin’ words and takin’ photos. [I had a bunch of goals for the week](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2021/08/08/writing-retreat-2021-day-zero/), but how’d I do?

***Get “The Slow Apocalypse” into at least a 2<sup>nd</sup>-draft state**, something that I can send out to beta readers.*

I got it most of the way there. I think I have one “What we will lose in the fire” section left to fill in, and I still need to go through and clean up all the \[TK\] notes I’ve left for myself. (Have I explained \[TK\] notes before? If not, I’ll have to do a post on that later.)

***Chronological framework for “Praise the Torch When ‘Tis Burned”**, and at least 1<sup>st</sup> drafts for all the scenes. Also consider how it’s going to be chopped up later.*

Whooo, this one. As I got closer to the end of the outline, I kept realizing that I needed to add in information earlier in the outline. So the outline’s deep into endgame, but not quite complete—but it *is* significantly expanded and clarified from where it was at the start of the week.

As for the chopping up: I’m starting to have 2nd thoughts about that. The story might not need it. But we’ll see.

***Work on a grant application for “Palimpsests”.***

I worked on it. There’s more work to do, of course. I suspect that grant applications, like novels, short stories, paintings, poems, *&amp;c.*, are never finished so much as abandoned.

***Astrophotography**: Dark sky shots of the Milky Way; star trails; Perseids; and, should the opportunity arise, the aurora.*

Oh yes. See the gallery below (which also has a few daylight shots around town).

***Biking** as much as I can/dare, considering the heat; aiming to break last year’s 60km. **Kayaking** at least a few times, since it’s fun and I have access to a kayak.*

Ha ha ha, joke’s on me. The daily high temperature while I was at the cabin was a good 10°C lower than the week before or (so far) this week. My bike riding was OK—I got about 40km on the bike—but the only day it felt warm enough to get out on the lake in the kayak was Saturday, my final day. So I got one paddle in, for about 45 minutes. It was still a great time.
