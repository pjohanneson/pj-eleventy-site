# Twilight at Spruces

My friend Tim is camping up at Wasagaming in [Riding Mountain](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/mb/riding/). I went to visit him last night, and before I came home we went to Spruces to check out the twilight. (We’d planned to check out the sunset but we got to talking, and time got away from us a little bit. So it goes.)

We saw a wolf, too, trotting down the highway, but I didn’t get a photo of him.
