# Awards Eligibility 2021

I had two stories appear in markets in 2021.

First up, in the spring, my super-short story “The Atlas” appeared in [*Cloud Lake*, Volume Two](https://www.cloudlakeliterary.ca/volume-two). “The Atlas” is 325 words long, and features an erased nation, a hunting knife, and a bottle of absinthe, among other delights.

> Jennifer said her great-to-the-*n*th-grandmother came from Untille. The country, erased in some primeval war, existed now only in folklore. On the atlas page it bordered Iraq, Uqbar, Syria.

And then, in the fall, my story “Summertime in the Void” appeared in *[Alternate Plains](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781773370644/darren-ridgley/alternate-plains?blnBKM=1)* (ie, the sequel to *Parallel Prairies*). It’s got varicoloured pills, theft, confessions, road trips, ghosts, and an answer to “What happens if the Rapture (or the Singularity) doesn’t want you?” (And yes, if you’re wondering, I absolutely stole the title from the I Mother Earth song.)

> The upside-down sun glared down on him from a cloudless blue sky. He’d tried explaining once to a friend what the sun looked like when it was upside-down. It hadn’t gone well. The best he’d managed to come up with was “You’ll know it when you see it.”

See you in 2022!
