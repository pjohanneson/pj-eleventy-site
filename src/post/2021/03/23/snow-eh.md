# Snow, eh?

I know, I know, I live in Canada. But every spring I get fooled into thinking that maybe the snow’s done now till next winter.

Still. At least it’s an opportunity to showcase one of my favourite graphs.

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-flickr wp-block-embed-flickr"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">[![(284) I occasionally draw graphs](https://live.staticflickr.com/3214/2404140455_1bbfdcfe2b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cerasaragirl/2404140455)</div></figure>(The header image is actually about 40 images, stacked using the same method I use for my star trails.)
