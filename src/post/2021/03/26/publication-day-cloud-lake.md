# Publication day!

Today is the release date for [Cloud Lake Literary, Volume 2](https://www.cloudlakeliterary.ca/volume-two), which contains my <abbr title="ie, 300 words">very short story</abbr> “The Atlas”, which features an atlas with at least one extra country, a bottle of absinthe, and a hunting knife.

I just checked my stats on [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com), and this one sold to the 18th market I submitted it to. 17 markets said, gently or bluntly, “Thanks but no” before this one found a home.

I guess the lesson is, Keep trying. Someone out there wants your story.

Writers: If you’re not using [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com), you owe it to yourself to at least look into it. It’s a market list for fiction and poetry, and it’s a submissions tracker, and it’s free. It’ll let you import your data from Duotrope (if you were using Duotrope before, it’s kind of like a less-polished Duotrope).
