# So close

I received this in the ol’ email inbox this afternoon.

> Thank you very much for your story, and for letting us hang on to it for as long as we did. The piece has received more than one read, as our first reader enjoyed it a great deal. Due to our current (thematic) publication needs, however, we are unable to place this story.

The funny thing is, they didn’t tell me which story they were rejecting, and I couldn’t remember what I’d submitted to their market. (I also couldn’t find my initial submission in my outbox, but that was less surprising; a lot of markets these days are using [Submittable](https://www.submittable.com/) or [Moksha](https://moksha.io/) or some other online submission gateway.)

Thank heavens for [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com). I did a quick search on the market name, and found that, yes, I had submitted a piece to them, wa-a-a-ay back in June 2020. Their submissions page said that they don’t generally send out rejections, so if you didn’t hear in about three months, assume you were not one of the lucky ones. I had assumed that, since September came and went with no word, that I was not one of the lucky ones.

Turns out I was right, but it seems I came closer than I thought.

Oh well. Once more unto the breach and all that. At least they liked the story; with form rejections it can be very hard to tell.

PS: If you’re a writer and you’re *not* using [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com), I strongly recommend you at least look into it.
