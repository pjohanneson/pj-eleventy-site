# Strunk + White

I had a dream the other night. I was visiting a friend—I don’t recall who, but it might have been one of the Craigs I know—and, left alone in a room, I was looking over the friend’s bookcase.

I found on there a copy of *[The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)*, colloquially known as “Strunk + White” after the authors. In the real world it’s a thin book, not much more imposing than a pamphlet; I’ve read novellas that are longer. But in the dream it was a trade paperback, probably 400 pages long, and I pulled it off the shelf. I used to have a copy, in the dream, and I thought maybe I’d lent it to this friend.

But if it was my copy, I hadn’t put my name in the front, which I usually do when I lend out a book. So I hesitated, contemplated taking it anyway, then decided not to risk it. I put it back on the shelf.

I don’t remember the rest of the dream.

When I searched the Internet for “Strunk and White”, I found [this article](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/strunk-and-white) from Mignon Fogarty, aka Grammar Girl, in which she lays out one reason why she doesn’t much care for *The Elements of Style*. (TL;DR: it’s a style guide that everyone treats like it’s a grammar book. In other words, it’s a set of suggestions that people instead treat like laws.)
