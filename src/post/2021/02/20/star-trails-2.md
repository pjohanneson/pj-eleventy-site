# Star Trails

Warmer than it’s been, but still cold enough to kill two camera batteries inside the space of ½ an hour. I gave up on seeing any aurora and headed home to process what I got.

**Update:** As it turned out, [I got some aurora after all](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2021/02/20/the-late-show/).

About 170 photos, 5 seconds each (for a total of about 15 minutes of rotation), ISO 1600, 11mm, *f*/2.8.
