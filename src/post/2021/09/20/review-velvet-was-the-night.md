# Review: Velvet Was the Night

<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"></div>A young woman has vanished. Her neighbour Maite is looking for her because she’s not willing to feed her cat forever. A possibly CIA-funded gangster, El Elvis, is looking for her too, for somewhat darker reasons.

*[Velvet Was the Night](https://silviamoreno-garcia.com/novels/velvet-was-the-night/)* by Silvia Moreno-Garcia is a mystery novel, a slow-burn noir set in Mexico City in the 1970s. It’s funny, tragic, startling, and violent. It’s full of comics and Elvis and unrest. It’s terrifying at times, sad at other times, and full of characters you root for and against, even if you’re not really sure you’d want to *meet* them.

I thought it was great, and I’m looking forward to reading more from this author.
