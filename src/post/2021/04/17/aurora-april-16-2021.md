# Aurora, April 16, 2021

Last night I took a drive, and got some shots of a diffuse aurora borealis on a back road a few miles outside of town.

</figure>I shot for about Â½ hour between 11 and 11:30 pm, and made a short timelapse video, too. Each second of video is about a minute in real-time.

The photo below is an <abbr title="high dynamic range">HDR</abbr> merge of two photos, to try to balance the brightness of the exterior with the darkness of the interior.
