# Yet Another Aurora Post

I had dozed off on the couch, and woke up about 12:45am or so. I thought, I should go to bed.

Then, brushing my teeth, I noticed there was quite a moon. So I check the aurora data and decided, what the hey, Iâ€™ve got the week off, I can stay up late on a school night.

So I packed my gear and headed out for about half an hour, and these photos are the result.
