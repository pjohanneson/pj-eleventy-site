# Bike ride, April 10, 2021

The weather’s supposed to turn wintry again for a few days, so I took advantage of today’s nice weather for a good long bike ride—27.8km, which took about 1¾ hour or so of cycling (I stopped to take photos and to chat with a friend, so I was gone from the house for 2½ hours).

I took my camera along, too, and snapped some photos.
