# Publications in 2021

Out now on the finer Internets everywhere: my (very) short story “The Atlas”, which features an atlas, a bottle of absinthe, and a hunting knife, published in [Volume 2 of *Cloud Lake Literary*](https://www.cloudlakeliterary.ca/volume-two).

Forthcoming in October 2021: *[Alternate Plains](https://www.greatplains.mb.ca/product/alternate-plains/)* (available for pre-order now!), featuring my story “Summertime in the Void”, which is one answer to the question “What if the Singularity didn’t want you?” (Canny CanCon types might wonder if I lifted the title from an I Mother Earth song. The answer is “Absolutely.”)

(It’s been a long time since I had two publications in the same calendar year. I think the last time was ’04, when [*On Spec*](https://onspec.ca/) published “[Resurrection Radio](https://patrickjohanneson.com/story/resurrection-radio/)” and I won the Manitoba Short Fiction contest with “[A Map to the End of the World](https://patrickjohanneson.com/story/a-map-to-the-end-of-the-world/)“.)
