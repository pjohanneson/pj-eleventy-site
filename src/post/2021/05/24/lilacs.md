# Lilacs

They have such a lovely smell and such a brief season.

</figure>**Update:** In a bit of weird synchronicity, I posted this the day before “[Wear the Lilac Day](https://wearthelilac.blogspot.com/p/what-is-wear-lilac-day.html)“, a day created by fans of the late Sir Terry Pratchett—one of my favourite authors—to commemorate his writing and to [support research into Alzheimer Disease](https://alzheimer.ca/en). Since [Dad had dementia](https://patrickjohanneson.com/category/jj/), this one strikes me a bit as “is the universe telling me something?”
