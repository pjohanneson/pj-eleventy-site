# A positive note

A bunch of rejections cropped up in my email in the last week or so. I know it’s part of the job (the game? the process?), but it’s not all that much fun.

As I was gearing up to re-submit the pieces in question, though, I got a cheery little message from a friend and fellow author, which made me feel better about the whole thing.

> Meant to say I quite enjoyed your story “The Smoke” and I hope you find a good placement for it. Didn’t have much else to add, I like the narrator and the ending. \[…\] Great job!

So, thanks for that, Chadwick.

Currently “The Smoke” is in the middle of editing, but I assure you I’ll be sending it back to him when it’s ready for the next round. If you’d like to read it too—it’s a viking/Iceland–inspired ghost story… *in space!*—do let me know.
