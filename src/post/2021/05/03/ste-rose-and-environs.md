# Ste. Rose and environs

Since I was in Dauphin today to supervise a judo grading, I took the long way home, swinging by my old home town, Ste. Rose du Lac.

I didn’t know what I should expect: would I feel all the feelings? Have I been away long enough that I would be dispassionate?

Turned out to be door number 2, mostly. I snapped a photo of our old house—I haven’t lived in it for, what, 30 years?—and mostly I was a) surprised by the addition of a chimney to the side of the house and b) impressed at how many vehicles fit in the ol’ driveway.

The town’s famous grotto, which I had intended to photograph, looks like it’s under construction—scaffolding everywhere—so I didn’t bother with pictures.

I stopped in briefly at École Laurier, where I learned français, and got a weird hit of nostalgia looking at the playground. I’m like 75% sure that the monkey bars there are the same ones a friend fell from in grade 2, breaking his arm.

I stopped just outside Laurier and snapped the 19 images that make up the header image, a panoramic view of Riding Mountain.
