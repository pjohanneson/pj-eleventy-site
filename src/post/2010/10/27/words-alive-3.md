# Words Alive (3)

[Part 1](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/2010/10/19/words-alive-1/) | [Part 2](http://www.patrickjohanneson.com/deardiary/2010/10/26/words-alive-2/)

People kept asking me all day — all week leading up to the weekend, really: “Are you nervous?” I’d answer “Yeah, somewhat”, or “Not really”, or “I used to read in church all the time”\*. I was a little nervous, though.

Friday afternoon, after the screenwriting session, I went home and — for the first time — read aloud the section I’d intended to read. I timed myself. It took four minutes to read the description of the dream palace erected by the gods at the far end of time. Four minutes. I had fifteen to fill.

Hmmm.

So I read the first half of the story aloud, which came to something like eleven or twelve minutes. That was more like it. The downside was that it was, well, a little sweary. The viewpoint character is a trickster god, named Fox, and he’s … earthy.

Which wouldn’t be so bad, but my mom was coming for the reading.

So. Reading time. The president of [Words Alive](http://wordsalivefestival.ca/) introduced me, and I went up with my copy of [Tesseracts 14](http://www.edgewebsite.com/books/tess14/t14-catalog.html), turned to my story, and started to read.

As I read, I looked out at the crowd every so often, to see what they were thinking. I honestly could not read them. Some looked like they were having fun; some were intent. At least none were sleeping; I decided that I’d call that a victory.

After my reading, I sat down, and listened to [Kathryn Borel, Jr.](http://www.kathrynborel.com/)‘s tales of France, her dad, and accidental vehicular manslaughter. When she was done, [Joseph Boyden](http://www.josephboyden.com/) read from his non-fiction tale of Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont. He said it was a strange thing, being able to read from the end of his book at a reading. You know, since we already know how it ends.

Afterward, there was a wine and cheese evening. I signed a few books, and had a chance to chat with both Joseph and Kathryn. Kathryn told me that I was a very funny guy, and needed just to loosen up a little. She also said that, when she’d come in, she’d seen my mother sitting there, and thought *Oh no*, since, as she says, she doesn’t usually go over well with mothers. But then I did my reading, swearing like a trickster god afflicted with ennui, and she sighed with relief.

Joseph had to leave early, to catch a plane to the next stop, but Kathryn joined the party as it left one venue and trooped to the next one. Later that evening, [she demonstrated the art of champagne sabering](http://www.absurdintellectual.com/2010/10/17/sabering-success/) in the street.

My mom and I left the party about one in the morning, as it was winding down (for most; the proprietor of Venue 2 was up till 3AM, cleaning up).

It was a great weekend.

And in a post-mortem way, I had two very exciting pieces of news at the next Group Voice\*\*\* meeting.

1. Joseph Boyden, disappointed that *Tesseracts* had sold out, asked Keith — the Words Alive prez, and bookstore proprietor — to ship him a copy once he’s restocked. I fully intend to sign it, too, before it heads down to New Orleans.
2. One of the audience members turned to Betty, a fellow writer in Group Voice, and asked her if all the stories in *Tesseracts* were written by yours truly. Betty told her no, it’s an anthology, and I have just the one story in it. “Too bad,” her friend said. “If it was all his, I’d buy a copy.”

Bit of an ego stroke, there.

All in all, I sure am looking forward to next year’s Festival! See you there?
