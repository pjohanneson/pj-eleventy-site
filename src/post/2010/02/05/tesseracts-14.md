# Tesseracts 14

So yeah. Tesseracts is an annual Canadian anthology of SF and fantasy.

This year, my short story “Heat Death, or, Answering the Ourobouros Question” will be in it.

To say I’m excited is to somewhat understate the case.

**Edit**—comments from the editors: “\[One editor\] wrote down ‘funny, lively, likeable.’ \[The other\] was even more enthusiastic!”
