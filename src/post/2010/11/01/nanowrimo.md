# Nanowrimo

I’m doing [nanowrimo](http://nanowrimo.org/)\* this year. My story’s title is *Once I Was You*. Here’s the first snippet, from the 1244 words I wrote in an hour this morning:

> As if on some silent cue, the doors of the school across the street at the far end of the park burst open, and children boiled out, their laughter too quiet to reach me. The buzzer sounded then, delayed by distance, and the joyful noise of hundreds of six- to ten-year-olds washed over me, a raucous burst of mirth and merriment, and even I, cold now of heart and mind, had to smile.

More to come, but right now I have to get to work. Toodles!
