# One more hit in Google

Oh hey look, [Edge Publishing](http://www.edgewebsite.com/) has added details about [Tesseracts 14](http://www.edgewebsite.com/books/tess14/t14-catalog.html) to their website. So that’s one more place my name will appear when I go ego-surfing.

Looks like it’s ready for pre-ordering, too:

Brandonites: [Pennywise Books](http://pennywise-books.blogspot.com/)  
Canucks: [Amazon.ca](http://www.amazon.ca/Tesseracts-Fourteen-Strange-Canadian-Stories/dp/1894063376/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1277396506&sr=1-1)  
Americans, and the rest of the world too: [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Tesseracts-Fourteen-Strange-Canadian-Stories/dp/1894063376/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1277396455&sr=1-1-fkmr0)

(Hint hint. Also, aside to Keith, if you’re reading this — if you’ve got a pre-order email address or something, I’d be abundantly happy to add it to the head of this list.)

I’m pretty excited, all over again! Also: I’ll be reading from my story “Heat Death, or, Answering the Ouroborous Question” at [Words Alive](http://wordsalivefestival.ca/) this year. If things work out, I’ll also be able to sign books there, just like a Real Proper Author.

Woo-hoo!
