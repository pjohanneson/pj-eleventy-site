# The game&#8217;s afoot

I’m not going to say too much about it yet — I’m still in the opening moments — but it seems that some pretty serious liberties have been taken with the copyright on a poem I had published way back in 1997. I found out about it by accident, from a relative in China, and initially assumed that it was part of the intellectual property piracy that China is, fairly or unfairly, known for.

Nope. Turns out the copyright infringement happened in my own province. In the educational system, no less.

So now I’m looking deeper, and trying to figure out what my next set of steps should be.

As for tonight, I’m writing, and then I’ll be running, and probably writing a bit more later. I need to find out about late 17th century embalming practices — did they use camphor, for instance? — and funeral rites. Any suggestions?
