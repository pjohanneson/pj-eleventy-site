# Interesting, to say the least

I got a new watch from my wife for my birthday last month. It’s a great watch, and I like it rather a lot.

[![My new watch](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2713/4444823446_f65bf7459f.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/4444823446/ "My new watch by Patrick Johanneson, on Flickr")

Today on my lunch break, for no other reason than “because I’m a nerd”, I punched my watch’s serial number into Google, expecting to find — I don’t know, maybe its incept date\*. Nothing much, anyways.

Instead, I found a US Marshal forfeiture auction listing *that included my watch*.

That’s it in the bottom middle of the lot.

The things you learn.

\[update\] Apparently, the auction company in question “sells all the jewelry\[etc.\] seized and forfeited nationally for the U.S. Marshals Service.” So… do I have a drug dealer’s watch? Was it seized in a tax forteiture? The rather shallow mystery deepens a very little bit.

\[2nd update\] As it turns out, there’s no mystery here. What I took to be a unique serial number was apparently in fact a global product number. So it wasn’t *my* watch in the property auction; just a watch *just like mine*.

\* See, there’s that nerd thing creeping in again.
