# News

It’s been a month since I had anything to say here. That month has been very busy at work, and I know more about WordPress than I did last month; that’s about all I’ll say for now.

I sent in my author photo and my bio to the Tesseracts publishers.

Judo has started up for another year.

I now have the schedule for this year’s [Words Alive festival](http://wordsalivefestival.ca/), and I’m reading on the Friday evening. Once the schedule’s online at the [Words Alive](http://wordsalivefestival.ca/) site, I’ll post a link.

And now I’m going to do some writing, before this long weekend slips away entirely.
