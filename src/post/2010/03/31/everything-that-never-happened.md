# Everything that Never Happened

…is a go. I finished the high-level outline of the novel last night. I printed the outline this morning — 18 pages — and at lunch hour today I’m going to start into writing the actual first draft. Even after two months of outlining, I’m still really excited about this project, which is a good sign.

Here are the two choices for the epigraph:

> *Inne ye Ocean yre is an Iland,  
> On ye Iland yre is a Stone,  
> Inne ye Stone, a Seed,  
> Inne ye Seed, the Death of us Alle.*  
> — From the Rutherford Codex, largely considered to be a fake

or

> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?  
> — Matthew 16:26

Any preferences out there in Reader Land?

Most novel updates will probably happen on the ETNH site: [http://patrickjohanneson.com/everything/](/everything/) .
