# Notes from judo class tonight

- I may need to order some belts before the next grading.
- Basketball practice downstairs is loud enough without the stereo.
- It’s really nice to hear someone tell you they appreciate all the years you’ve been volunteering.
- It never occurred to me that instructing at judo is *volunteering*, but of course it is.
- Since when is Europe’s “The Final Countdown” a big hit again?
- Half an hour of ne-waza randori is lots, thanks.
