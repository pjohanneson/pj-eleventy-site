# The Once and Future King

For many years I fobbed it off, since it was fantasy, and I was for a long time a snob about such things. (Science fiction was good; fantasy was not. Thanks, Sir Terry Pratchett, for finally showing me the error of my ways.)

For years I’ve meant to read it, but never got around to it.

Now I’m reading it, and I’m wondering two things:

1. Why didn’t I read this *years* ago?
2. Why did no one ever tell me how *funny* it is?

Current read: *The Once and Future King* by T. H. White.

(Well, so far it’s funny, but I’m only getting near the end of Book I (of IV).)
