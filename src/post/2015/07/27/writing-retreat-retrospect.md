# Writing retreat: Retrospect

Well, I’m back home again. I had a delightful time up at the cabin. I got about 6500 new words written in *The Shadow Crusade*, which doesn’t include the 4500-word outline that I hammered out (which especially targets the endgame of the novel). That should hopefully help me focus in on the story, and avoid my unfortunate habit of noodling.

I can almost hear my wife’s voice now: *Write **faster**, Johanneson!* (With a tip o’ the hat to Michael Swanwick and his wife Marianne Porter, of course.)

Next week: Back to work. (The day job, that is.) No vacation is ever long enough, especially when viewed in the rear-view mirror.

Thanks a million, E&amp;K, for the use of the cabin.
