# Whoa. Psychoanalytic criticism.

Someone, back in 2013, took it upon himself (or herself) to run my vignette “Eating Everything That Ever Was” (\[available in [“Seven Very Short Stories”](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/seven-very-short-stories/)) through the lens of Freudian literary criticism.

[And here it is.](https://prezi.com/lgpaffz_5cg-/psychoanalytic-criticism/)

My story starts on the 7th click, and the analysis happens on the 8th. I had no idea I was writing about a mother/son dynamic. (Though I suppose you could argue that I *always* am; that we *always* are.)

This is awesome. (Also completely kosher, per the [CC](http://creativecommons.org/) that the story is licensed under.)
