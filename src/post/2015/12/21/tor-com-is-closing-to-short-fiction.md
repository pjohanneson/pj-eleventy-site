# Tor.com is closing to short fiction

As of January 7th, 2016, [Tor.com will no longer accept unsolicited short fiction](http://www.tor.com/2015/12/21/tor-com-is-closed-to-short-fiction-submissions/).

> On <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">January 7th</span></span> Tor.com will close its short fiction submissions system. Our dedicated editors and readers will read through and respond to everything that is submitted up to that point, but we do not plan to reopen in the foreseeable future.

So if you’ve got something that you’re planning to send them, do it *now*.

If you miss the window, well, there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Or [markets in the æther](http://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/), as the case may be.

(If you need me, I’ll be rummaging through my unpublished corpus, looking to see if I’ve got anything even *close* to ready.)
