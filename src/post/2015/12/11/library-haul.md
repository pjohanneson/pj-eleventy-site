# Library haul

Went down to the public library tonight, since my copies of Neil Gaiman’s *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* and John Scalzi’s *The End of All Things* were due back.

(Reviews: *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* was a spooky coming-of-age/memoir tale from a master of eerie fantasy; *The End of All Things* further solidified my view of John Scalzi as my generation’s Joe Haldeman (though it might have been smart of me to read *The Human Division* first).)

So I went in without any plans as to what I wanted to check out. I *did* check the catalogue for the status of Emily St. John Mandel’s *Station Eleven*, which has been checked out every time I’ve gone looking for it. Tonight was no exception. *One day* (shakes fist at the sky).

But by and large I had no agenda. I checked the New Releases section, and snagged Chuck Wendig’s *Aftermath*. Then I wandered over to the SF/F section, which is where I usually end up. Grabbed another volume there — a four-novel omnibus of Philip K. Dick novels, which either a) has fantastically small print or b) serves as a reminder of how short novels could be back in the 60s. And then I took a gander at the graphic novels, where I grabbed my third and final volume: Scott McCloud’s *Sculptor*.

I’m looking forward to all of these. I just can’t decide which should be first.

Help?
