# Writing Advice (no. 21 in a series of ∞)

From one of my favourite authors, the great Michael Swanwick:

> It’s not just that the stories I read the other day are fables of consolation while the classics set out to overthrow the reader’s complacency. It’s that in the great stories *things change*. Irrevocably.
> 
>  And science fiction is the literature of change.
