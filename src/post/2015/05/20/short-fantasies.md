# Short fantasies

There’s an article in [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/) by one Natasha Pulley which posits that [proper fantasy world-building can’t be accomplished in a short story](http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/may/20/fantasy-imaginary-worlds-george-r-r-martin-robin-hobb), and that’s why so many fantasy novels these days are a) hefty and b) continued in multi-volume series.

I offer the following counterpoints:

- the short fantasies of Michael Swanwick (for example, “The Dragon Line” or “Radio Waves”)
- the very existence of the *Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction*
- …and *Beneath Ceaseless Skies*
- …and *Fantasy Faction*
- …and so forth.
