# Daily SF: &#8220;Person to Person&#8221;

**Update:** Well, today’s the day. [“Person to Person”](http://dailysciencefiction.com/fantasy/religious/patrick-johanneson/person-to-person) is now up on DSF’s site.

On May 18th, my short story “Person to Person” will appear in [Daily Science Fiction](https://www.dailysciencefiction.com/). When it’s posted, I’ll be sure to add a link to his post.

Here’s a teaser:

> Jake called from Heaven again.

That’s the first line, and it just came to me, a gift from on high<sup id="fnref-1713:1">[1](#fn-1713:1)</sup>, and I knew I had to use it. I spent some time deciding whether I meant it literally or not; once that was settled, the story essentially wrote itself (which is in itself another gift).
