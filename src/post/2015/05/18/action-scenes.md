# Action scenes

Earlier this week I read an article on [io9](http://io9.com) about [why you shouldn’t write action scenes](http://io9.com/why-you-should-never-write-action-scenes-into-your-tent-511712234), an article aimed at screenwriters, especially those making big-budget action movies. Then this afternoon, I went to see one of the biggest action films currently in theatres: *Avengers: Age of Ultron*.

From the article:

> You don’t do an action sequence for the sake of doing a damn action sequence — you do an action sequence because it’s a new or more effective way to advance your character or story.

*Ultron* featured a lot — *a lot* — of action sequences. The bulk of them, to my eye, were action for the sake of action. A few of them — the mass fight at the start, for example — featured some character building. Among other things, it established the team as an actual, cohesive team, and it showed the start of the Widow/Hulk storyline. But a lot of the later action sequences were there, it seemed, to Make Things Explode. More than once I found myself wondering when they were going to get back to the story. (That, or trying to calculate just how much money Stark’s rebuilding fund must burn through in a year. It’s got to be *a lot*.)

This is not to say I didn’t enjoy the movie. I liked it. It was a pleasant diversion. For a big stupid fun movie, it was decently smart (though the whole plot hinged on a couple of supergenius scientists making some pretty boneheaded decisions).

Once more, quoting from the article:

> Don’t write action sequences. Write suspense sequences that require action to resolve.

We’ll call *Ultron* a partial success there. Here’s hoping that the next film I see — slated to be *Mad Max: Fury Road*<sup id="fnref-1721-1">[1](#fn-1721-1)</sup> — does as well or better.

**Update:** I watched *Mad Max: Fury Road* on the holiday Monday. Even though the movie is one protracted action scene (or maybe it’s more like a dozen or so action scenes, linked together with brief pauses so the audience can catch their collective breath), it had more character development and sense of story than *Avengers: Age of Ultron*. So that’s a win.
