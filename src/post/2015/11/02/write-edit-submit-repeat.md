# Write, edit, submit, repeat

I just submitted a new/old short story — “The Ravens” — to Corey Redekop’s [Canlit Comedy anthology](http://www.coreyredekop.ca/canlit-comedy/). Fingers crossed.

I actually wrote the story a few years ago, and submitted it to a couple markets, who rejected it. It seemed like the right idea for a humour piece, so I tried to resurrect it…

…but I couldn’t find the original file *anywhere*.

And so I re-wrote it from the ground up. I think it turned out all right. I read it today at Write Club, and there was quite a lot of laughter. I’m going to call that a good sign.

Wish me luck!

**Update:** Well, I’ve made it into the 2nd round. Fingers still crossed. (Crampin’ a little bit…)
