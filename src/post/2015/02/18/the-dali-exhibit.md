# The Dalí Exhibit

We went in to Winnipeg this past weekend to visit family. While we were there, my mother pointed out that the Salvador Dalí collection — which had been scheduled to leave town at the end of last month — had been held over for another three weeks. I’d resigned myself to not seeing any of it.

So when I found out it was still in town, well, I think you might be able to guess what I did on Sunday afternoon.
