# Music Monday: Sol Invictus

I’m not sure if **Music Monday** is a *thing*, or if [Chadwick is just trying to *make* it a *thing*](http://chadwickginther.com/2015/06/29/music-monday-under-pressure-by-queen-david-bowie/), but either way here’s my response (riposte?) to his Queen post.

Faith No More put out a new album earlier this year, their first release in 18 years. Because I’m old, I bought the CD. Here’s a live version of the first track, “Sol Invictus” (which is also the title of the album). It’s a quiet meditation on the loss of faith.

*I believe in something, I think* — for some reason that line really gets me.

Also, for those looking for something a bit louder and more aggressive, well, the new album has you covered, too.

Here’s “Superhero”, the second track:
