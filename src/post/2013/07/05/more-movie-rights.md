# More movie rights

An amateur filmmaker contacted me via my [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/patrickjohanneson), asking about permission to make a film based on my micro-story “Dancing” (which is available in the [Seven Very Short Stories](http://patrickjohanneson.com/fiction/seven-very-short-stories/)).

My answer, in short, was **Yes!**.
