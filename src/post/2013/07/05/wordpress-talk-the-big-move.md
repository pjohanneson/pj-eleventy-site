# WordPress talk: The Big Move

Apparently my talk from [WordCamp Toronto Dev](http://2012.torontodev.wordcamp.org/) has gone online.

[*in situ*](http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/04/patrick-johanneson-the-big-move-brandon-university-case-study/) on WordCamp.tv

Found via [WPDaily.co](http://wpdaily.co/focus-on-universities-and-wordpress/). (Holy crap, my name shows up on WPDaily.co!)

(Also: I’ve since updated my code to use `get_option()` and its siblings in the Options API, rather than using `$wpdb` to update the options. In non-nerd words, I’m using The WordPress Way instead of The Dumb Way.)

Maybe my [Winnipeg](http://patrickjohanneson.com/2013/06/02/wordcamp-winnipeg-2/) one will go live soon too. A boy can dream…
