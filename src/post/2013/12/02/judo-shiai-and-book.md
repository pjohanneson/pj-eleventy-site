# Judo: shiai and book

I went into the city this past weekend to referee at the [University of Manitoba’s annual *shiai*](http://www.judomanitoba.mb.ca/phpwcms/index.php?2013-u-of-m-open) <sup id="fnref-1437:1">[1](#fn-1437:1)</sup>. Considering I hadn’t refereed since the beginning of April, I feel I did fairly well. I got a compliment on the way out for catching a couple of “false attack” penalties — apparently they get missed fairly frequently — so I felt pretty good about that.

Next day, on the way out of town, I stopped in at [McNally Robinson](http://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/), one of my favourite bookstores, and ended up finding [*The Way of Judo*](http://www.shambhala.com/the-way-of-judo.html) on the shelf. It’s a biography of Jigoro Kano, aka Kano-*sensei*, the founder of Judo. I waffled for a moment, but only for a moment; then I picked it up. I haven’t started it yet, but I’m looking forward to it, for sure.
