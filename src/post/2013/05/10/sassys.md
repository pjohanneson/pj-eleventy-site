# Sassy&#8217;s

When I saw they were tearing Sassy’s down, my first thought was *Oh, no*.

*…I have a scene set in there in my novel-in-progress.*

(It’s one of the places where the underground dwellers can come up above ground.)

Sassy’s, for the uninitiated, <del>is</del> was a downtown-Brandon dive bar. For a long time it was a strip club, and by all accounts not a classy one. It’s the only place I’ve ever actually gone to see the strippers—during my low-key bachelor party, when we set the drink special at a pizza joint, then drank multicoloured drinks at the bowling alley—but that’s a story for another day.

Sassy’s also played host to the local instance of [the smalls’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REF5snOUkJE) “Goodbye Forever” tour, to which I scored free tickets by putting up posters around [the university](http://www.brandonu.ca/). The stripper pole was gone, but the ceiling mirrors hadn’t been torn down. The smalls played on a stage that I presume had been thoroughly cleaned.
