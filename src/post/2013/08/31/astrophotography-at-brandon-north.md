# Astrophotography at Brandon North

Brandon North is a now-abandoned train station north of the city of Brandon â€” actually north of Forrest, which is north of Brandon. I headed up there a couple nights ago, hoping for dark skies so I could take some photos of stars.

Alas, the station itself is now more brightly-lit than when it was in service. However, just down the hill, the lights are mostly blocked. I got some good photos:
