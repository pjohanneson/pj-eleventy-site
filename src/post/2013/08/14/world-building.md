# World-building

There’s an article on io9.com [asking whether *The Phantom Menace* has better world-building than *Star Wars*](http://io9.com/does-the-phantom-menace-have-better-worldbuilding-than-1026016172) <sup id="fnref-1386:1">[1](#fn-1386:1)</sup>. The debate, in my mind, boils down to this: *Show* vs. *Tell*. Every book, every article on writing that I’ve ever read stressed one core rule for exposition, and by extension for world-building<sup id="fnref-1386:2"> [2](#fn-1386:2)</sup>: **Show, don’t tell**.

[Charlie Jane Anders](http://charliejane.kinja.com/), the author of the [io9](http://io9.com) piece, comes down in favour of *Show, don’t tell*. She shares my view that the original film had far better world-building than the first prequel, because *Star Wars* *showed* you the world you were in, with little pieces in virtually every scene, whereas *The Phantom Menace* *told* you most of what you “needed” to know, either in the opening crawl or in “as you know, Bob” <sup id="fnref-1386:3">[3](#fn-1386:3)</sup>-style dialogue.

I much prefer my science fiction — actually, *any* fiction — to stay clear of too many giant expository information dumps. (One series that kind of annoyed me for this reason was the *Hyperion Cantos* by Dan Simmons — the story was flowing along pretty well, and then the final book featured a lengthy chapter that was essentially one character explaining the story to a group of other (and, by proxy, the reader). It stopped every hint of forward momentum, and it let me down, I feel, as a reader.)

Here’s a list of novels &amp; series that I think did their world-building right:

- Frank Herbert’s amazing *Dune* saga<sup id="fnref-1386:4"> [4](#fn-1386:4)</sup>
- Michael Swanwick’s *Stations of the Tide*
- William Gibson’s novels — I have a soft place in my heart for the Sprawl trilogy, especially
- Joe Haldeman’s *Forever War*
- Stephen King’s *Dark Tower* saga — the opening line spoke volumes: “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”

Looking at my list, it seems that I like stories that dump me into the story in the middle — *in media res*, as they say — and then let me build the world in my own mind as I read.

What about you? Where have you seen/read exceptional world-building?

1. Fine, fine, *A New Hope*. [↩](#fnref-1386:1)
2. Really, world-building is a class of exposition, one that requires as light a touch as any other. [↩](#fnref-1386:2)
3. “As you know, Bob, the Force is carried by symbiotic bloodstream parasites called oh look the entire audience is snoozing now.” [↩](#fnref-1386:3)
4. Nope, not the prequels. They would have made me happier by simply publishing Frank’s notes. [↩](#fnref-1386:4)
