# Íslendingadagurinn ´013

As is my wont, I went to Gimli during the August long weekend for the annual [Icelandic Festival](http://www.icelandicfestival.com/). My wife and my mother accompanied me.

Craving some Viking combat reenactment? They got you covered.

More of a sandcastle-admiring type? You’re still in good hands.

[![Mmmm, pickerel. (Shot in Gimli during Íslendingadagurinn.)](https://live.staticflickr.com/3824/9473613653_1cafd62407.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/9473613653/)

Delicious and inexpensive pickerel for supper? Yes please.
