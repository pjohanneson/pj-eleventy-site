# Happy Buy Nothing Day

I work at a university, and usually, sometime around the middle of November, someone puts up a passel of [BUY NOTHING DAY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_Nothing_Day) posters. Now that the big day is upon us, I realize that I havenâ€™t seen any posters up this year.

And I wonder: Was it *my* turn this year? Did I shirk my duty?
