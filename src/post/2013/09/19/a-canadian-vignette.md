# A Canadian vignette

I have this single scene for a film in my head, very Canadian: a shot of a southbound V of geese, moving across a pale blue sky. The camera pans down to a solitary person on the ground, standing in the middle of the street, yelling up at them, “Quitters! Get back here!”

Filmmakers: If you’d like to use this in your film, please let me know. I’m sure we can work something out.
