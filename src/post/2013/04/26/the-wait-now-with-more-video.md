  epigraph: On the seventh day she snoozed under a cloudless sky, waking only briefly
    when a dragonfly happened to touch down on her nose. She observed its cathedral-window
    wings, irridescent with refracted sunlight, and drowsed once more after it left
    her.

# &#8220;The Wait&#8221; &#8212; now with more video!

I think it’s gorgeous and amazing, and I feel quite honoured by it.
