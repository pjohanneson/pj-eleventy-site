# &#8220;The Wait&#8221; &#8212; now with more video!

Ego-surfing, I found this:

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXu3vq4isio?feature=oembed" title="The Wait" width="500"></iframe>

I think it’s gorgeous and amazing, and I feel quite honoured by it.
