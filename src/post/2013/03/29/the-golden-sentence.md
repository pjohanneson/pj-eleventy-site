# The Golden Sentence

My friend Donna came up with the idea of the [Golden Sentence](http://loweeda.tumblr.com/post/39599369120/the-golden-sentence-project), and I think it’s great.

Pick a book at random (or not-so-random), check the total number of pages, and divide by φ (aka the [Golden Ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), aka 1.618…). Now go to the page you get, count the number of sentences, and divide *that* number by φ. Count the sentences till you get to that one. That’s your Golden Sentence.

I’ve been making my slow, savouring way through Gene Wolfe’s *Wizard Knight* duology, and so here are the golden sentences for those two books:

> I would have liked to have Hob there, too; and in a way he was, because he was what the rest of us were thinking about.
> 
> —*The Knight*
> 
> “We told her we had no subjects, that the Angrborn follow King Schildstarr, that though a queen we do not rule.”
> 
> —*The Wizard*

(Some context: in *The Knight*, Hob wasn’t there because an ogre had eaten him, which was sort of why they were all thinking about him; in the snippet from *The Wizard*, Queen Idnn of Jotunland, newly-married to King Gilling, is speaking, using the royal “we”.)

What’s the Golden Sentence for *your* favourite book? (Or even the one nearest you?)
