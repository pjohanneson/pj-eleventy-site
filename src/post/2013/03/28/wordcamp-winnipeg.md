# WordCamp Winnipeg

I’ll be [speaking](http://2013.winnipeg.wordcamp.org/speakers/) at [Winnipeg’s inaugural WordCamp](http://2013.winnipeg.wordcamp.org/)! I’ll talk about my experiences with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) Multisite, which I use at [work](http://www.brandonu.ca/) every single day. It’s a great system but it does have its little *gotcha!* moments.

[Tickets are on sale now!](http://2013.winnipeg.wordcamp.org/tickets/)
