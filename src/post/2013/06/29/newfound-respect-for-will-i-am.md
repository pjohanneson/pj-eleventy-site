# Newfound respect for will.i.am

I used to like the Black Eyed Peas, at least for a little while. I first heard of them when this song came out:

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpYeekQkAdc?feature=oembed" title="The Black Eyed Peas - Where Is The Love? (Official Music Video)" width="500"></iframe>

But then it seemed like they slid down the slope into cheeseball pop music, and I found myself disappointed, the kind of disappointment you feel when someone with great potential to do something good decides that it’s more interesting to be famous than to be good. (I don’t know. Maybe “Where Is The Love” was an outlier in the band’s career, or something.)
