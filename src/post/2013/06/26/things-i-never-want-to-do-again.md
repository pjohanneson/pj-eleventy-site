# Things I never want to do again

Drive down a flooding avenue — and a major traffic artery to boot — in a truck with crappy wiper blades on a wiper motor that randomly just *stops*, on bald tires, with iffy brakes, during a torrential downpour with hail pinging off the roof. Oh, and the defrost isn’t working worth a darn so the windows keep fogging up. *All* the windows.
