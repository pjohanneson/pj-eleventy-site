# To Do list

Things I should do in the next while:

- <del>Make a list</del>
- <del datetime="2013-06-05T17:26:54+00:00">Laundry</del>
- Install some project management software and start using it for personal projects
- <del datetime="2013-06-05T17:49:55+00:00">Go through the cards I got on my busy weekend and connect up</del>
- New theme for my site
- Write, write, write
- Prep for my readings

### Addendum

- Run some numbers
