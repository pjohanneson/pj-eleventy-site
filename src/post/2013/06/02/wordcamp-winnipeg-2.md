# WordCamp Winnipeg

[One great WordCamp](http://2013.winnipeg.wordcamp.org/), indeed.

I learned about [Ian Stewart’s](http://iandanielstewart.com/) journey from utter WordPress “noob” to member (lead?) of the Automattic Theme Team.

I learned that there are still seven or eight things I don’t know about WordPress, courtesy of [Sheri Bigelow](http://designsimply.com/).

I learned from tri.be’s [Peter Chester](http://tri.be) how to fix WordPress when it’s slow (Find the slowest thing; fix it; rinse and repeat).

I taught an intimidatingly full room of people that [WordPress Multisite](http://www.slideshare.net/pjohanneson/wordpress-multisite-22262081) isn’t really all *that* scary.

I learned from [Reid Peifer](http://reidpeifer.com/) about how you should manage a distributed team (final rule: [GIVE A CRAP](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pj/8932766082/)).

And I learned from [Dave Pensato](http://davidpensato.com/) that while WordPress is awesome, it could probably be *more* awesome still. (Blinky FTW.)

Then I had some snacks and went to visit my family. A good day all around.
