# Apprenticeship Reading

Since January, I’ve been mentoring two sixteen-year-old apprentices, Becky &amp; Tanner, in creative writing under [a program by ACI](http://www.creativemanitoba.ca/youth/rural-mentorship). It’s been a great time, and we’ve covered a lot of ground: character development, world-building, [plot outlining](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/), essay writing, the whole copyright / licensing / [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) imbroglio, editing, taxes and what you can legitimately claim, [infinite libraries](http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html), and a pile of other topics.

Today, we held a small friends-and-family reading. I read my short story [Exit Interview](http://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/aliens/patrick-johanneson/exit-interview), Becky read a 2nd-person short story (“The Great Ant Race”) and a snippet from her novel-in-progress *The Cigám Triad*, and Tanner gave a presentation titled “Why the Education System Sucks”, which was about the difference between *interest* and *passion*, and how the education system needs a revolution to nurture the latter.

It was a great end to a fantastic experience. I intend to stay in touch with my apprentices, and I look forward to reading and hearing more of their work.

Thanks, [ACI](http://www.creativemanitoba.ca/), for this opportunity. And thanks, Becky and Tanner, for being great apprentices, or mentalists, or manatees, or whatever the right word is.
