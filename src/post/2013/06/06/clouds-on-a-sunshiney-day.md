# Clouds on a sunshiney day

This evening I set up my camera on a tripod, with a wall wart providing power, and pointed at the sky. I used [CHDK](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK) to ask that it take one photo every 30 seconds till I told it to stop. I started it about 6:30 PM and shut it down about 9:00.

Thatâ€™s the result.

Next up: more star trails.
