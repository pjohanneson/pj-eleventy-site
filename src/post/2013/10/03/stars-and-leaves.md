# Stars and leaves

I went in to the Winnipeg WordPress meetup last night and talked about what to do when you hit a [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/) page that has the dreaded `There is currently no text in this page`. (The slides from the presentation are at the end of this page.)

On the way home, I stopped in at the halfway tree for some star shots. I canâ€™t decide which one I like best:

or
