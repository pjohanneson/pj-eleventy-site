# Jupiter at perigee

[Jupiter is currently about as close as it gets to Earth.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/see-jupiter-shine-during-its-closest-approach-to-earth-since-1963/) I went out tonight hoping to catch some aurora, but the show was pretty meh. So I aimed my 250mm lens at Jupiter instead, and caught it with its moons (left to right) Ganymede, Europa, Io, and Callisto.
