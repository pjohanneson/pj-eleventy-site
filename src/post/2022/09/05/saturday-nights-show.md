# Saturday night&#8217;s show

We went down to Boissevain on the weekend to help out with the [Dunrea Flea Market](https://www.facebook.com/tdrfm/posts/5728226923907227)((It rather outgrew the available space in Dunrea.)), and stayed over at our friends’ farmhouse a few miles south of town. There were a few shows put on by the Northern Lights that night; I caught one of them. They danced for about 20 minutes while I watched. Here are some of the photos I got.

Unfortunately my image-stitching program balked at creating a panorama; the aurora were moving too much for the software to find similarities in the photos. I manually aligned them instead.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">[![Aurora Borealis (panorama)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_4467-pano-2000-1024x328.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_4467-pano-2000-1024x328.jpg)</figure>And I did up a quick timelapse. The 33 seconds of video represents about 33 minutes of photos, each one a 5-second exposure.

One more photo, I thought, then I’ll go inside.
