# Blackbirds in my yard

> Blackbirds, blackbirds up in a tree  
> Count them, count them, what do they see?  
> One for sorrow, two for joy  
> Three for a girl, four for a boy  
> Five for silver, six for gold  
> Seven for a secret that’s never been told
> 
> <cite>Traditional rhyme</cite>

I’ve been leaving the fallen leaves where they lay in my yard. I’ve heard it’s good for the local ecology, given beneficial bugs and small rodents a place to winter outside.

The other day, a squadron of blackbirds came for a visit. Seems I may have left them some snacks. Circle of life, I suppose.
