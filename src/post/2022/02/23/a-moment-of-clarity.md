# A moment of clarity

This afternoon, washing dishes and listening to music, I had a writing epiphany. The song “Moment of Clarity” by 13 Engines popped up in the rotation…

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TLQ9ClBme7M?feature=oembed" title="13 Engines Moment Of Clarity" width="500"></iframe></div></figure>…and one part of it, specifically, strikes a chord on my current <abbr title="Work in Progress">WiP</abbr>.

> A moment of clarity is all that’s required of me  
> And all other places and other times, they’re waving goodbye  
> Goodbye

Yeah, that’s all the context you’re gonna get for now. Let me know if you’re interested in reading this once it’s all done, though.
