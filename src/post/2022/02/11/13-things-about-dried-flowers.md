# 13 things about &#8220;Dried Flowers&#8221;

[Thursday Thirteen](http://newthursday13.blogspot.com/), the late edition.

(Remember Thursday Thirteens? How about Random Flickrblogging? No? Sigh.)

Moving on. Here are 13 things that you’ll find once my story “Dried Flowers” is available for reading.

1. Unreliable 3rd-person narration
2. Palimpsests ((I mean, the working title was “Palimpsests”))
3. [Florilegia](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/florilegium)
4. [HIC SVNT DRACONES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)
5. [Library apartment](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/inside-the-new-york-public-librarys-last-secret-apartments)
6. Birthday cake ((HAP BIRT NAO))
7. Romans à clé ((Well, kind of))
8. Wholly invented books
9. An autograph seeker
10. Snow falling upward
11. Overheard conversations
12. Women who take male noms de plume
13. Acrostics

<abbr title="In Case You're Wondering">ICYW</abbr>: “Dried Flowers” is my current work in progress. Formerly titled “Palimpsests”, the story is about a library whose books all seem to be erasing themselves.

This storytelling is supported by a grant from the [Manitoba Arts Council](https://artscouncil.mb.ca/).
