# Colour photo of a greyscale world

Today was the start of the blizzard ’round these parts. I took this photo of the lacy snow on my front picture window at about 1:20 PM, after I’d shoveled the walk for a second time.

The snow keeps coming, but not as bad here as other places; I’d be happy, though, if the wind would just die down a bit. I guess that’s what I get for living on the prairie.

Nerdy details: 50mm, *f*/2.8, 1/4000s, ISO 100.
