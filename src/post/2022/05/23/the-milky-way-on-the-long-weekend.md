<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="334" loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/712951837?h=ef64f7eeae&dnt=1&app_id=122963" title="Milky Way - May 23, 2022" width="500"></iframe></div></figure>The aurora data were pretty meh last night, but I went out anyway and got some shots of the Milky Way climbing in the east. The video is the better part of an hourâ€™s images, all shot at 11mm, *f*/2.8, ISO 3200.
