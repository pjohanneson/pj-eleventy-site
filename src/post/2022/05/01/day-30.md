# Day 30

For the 30th day of April, and my 27th day of biking in April((I missed 3 days because a Colorado low dropped enough rain that I couldnâ€™t get to the garage.)), I went for a 16km bike ride and managed to snap a couple photos while I was out.

Above: A classic car I spotted on a side street.

Below: The north wind was not fun to bike into, but at least it made the flags snap.
