# Hollow Bean 2022: The Costumes

This year’s lightly-annotated list of Hallowe’en costumes:

- Li’l tiny kitten (She was 3, maybe 4 at the outside. Rang the bell, very clearly said “Trick or treat”, thanked me for the candy. Her mom, from the sidewalk, said “You did it all by yourself! I’m so proud of you!” So was I.)
- Li’l purple dragon
- Grim Reaper
- Flapper
- Traveler (or what we might, in less enlightened times, have called a “gypsy”)
- 2 boxes of Nerds (one was grape, I couldn’t make out the other; both had the Nutritional Information printed on the backs of their costumes)
- Angel
- Bear
- Bearded dad (The angel and bear both asked if we had gluten-free bars, which—turns out—apparently Aero fits the bill. I gave their dad a Coffin Crisp because a) the kids were super polite about it and b) he seemed really patient.)
- Great Pumpkin
- Santa Claus

We shut the light off at 9 pm, having watched the [Knock Knock Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock_Knock_Ghost) episode where they explore the [Diefenbunker](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2019/09/30/ottawa-days-7-8/), among other spooky specials.
