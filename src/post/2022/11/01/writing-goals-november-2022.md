# Writing Goals: November 2022

I’m doing [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) this year, sort of. Instead of pushing hard for 50,000 words in a brand-new project, I’m going to use the month to try and finish the first draft of *Dried Flowers*. My aim is at least 300 words each and every day. So far today I’m at 307 words, and I think I’m going to do a bit more after I finish this post.

I’ll try to make sure to post update here every so often (let’s say weekly, so I’m not boring you).

Wish me luck!
