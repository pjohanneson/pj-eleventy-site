# Writing Retreat 2022: Wrap-up

How’d I do against [my goals](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2022/08/21/writing-retreat-2022-goals/)?

- **write at least 10,000 words** in “Dried Flowers”: Check. The novel went from 33,000 words to 45,000.
- **get some astrophotography done**. Check: see below.
- **read some books**. I read the last chapter in *Fugitive Telemetry*, the last 6 chapters in *The Book of the New Sun*, and made my way a bit over half-way through *Catch-22*. Also, I borrowed the next *Sandman* collection from one of the library’s online resources, and read a couple chapters in it.
- **ride my bike**. A little; one 6km ride and a few quick runs across the dam into town to go to the coffee shop, so as to use their wifi.
- **go kayaking**. I got out on the water on Thursday and Friday, for a total of about 8½km.
- **relax**. Yes? I had a hard time sleeping past 7 am, but otherwise it was a relaxing week.

All in all, this was a good retreat. As always, I wish it had been longer, but you know what they say: so it goes.
