# After sunset, Aug. 5, 2022

I went to visit my friend Tim up at Wasagaming. We went out to Spruces for sunset, and on the way back to town we stopped in at the golf course/wishing well scenic spot. I was scouting possible locales for future astrophotography (it was cloudy that night, so I didnâ€™t get any stars shot last night), and I decided to try my hand at <abbr title="High Dynamic Range">HDR</abbr>ing the post-sunset glow in the sky.

I think it turned out OK.

HDR, or [High Dynamic Range](https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-hdr-photography/): You take multiple photos in quick succession, at different exposures, and then combine them to pull out the most detail at all light levels. I used the following 3 photos to make the above image (manually edited in [GIMP](https://gimp.org/)).
