# On a cloudy night

The aurora forecast was great, but the earthly forecast was clouds, clouds, clouds. I ventured out anyway, hoping against hope for a small break in the clouds.

On the back road I chose, there were clouds all around, and lightning—lots of it—to the south and east. I didn’t hear any thunder, but there were moments where the clouds lit up from within. I managed to get one bright bolt in focus.

If you view the photo full-size, you’ll see two moons as well: Callisto on the left and Ganymede on the right (if I’m using [this tool](https://skyandtelescope.org/wp-content/plugins/observing-tools/jupiter_moons/jupiter.html) correctly).

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">[![Jupiter, with Callisto and Ganymede visible](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_0869-2000-1024x682.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_0869-2000.jpg)</figure>Then, before heading home, I decided to take a couple shots of the northern sky. There was a hint of green to it. This is the best photo I managed of the aurora trying to peek through the clouds.
