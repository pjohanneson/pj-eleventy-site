# On a cloudy night

The aurora forecast was great, but the earthly forecast was clouds, clouds, clouds. I ventured out anyway, hoping against hope for a small break in the clouds.

On the back road I chose, there were clouds all around, and lightning—lots of it—to the south and east. I didn’t hear any thunder, but there were moments where the clouds lit up from within. I managed to get one bright bolt in focus.

If you view the photo full-size, you’ll see two moons as well: Callisto on the left and Ganymede on the right (if I’m using [this tool](https://skyandtelescope.org/wp-content/plugins/observing-tools/jupiter_moons/jupiter.html) correctly).

There was a hint of green to it. This is the best photo I managed of the aurora trying to peek through the clouds.
