# Writing Retreat 2022: Goals

This year I’m at a cabin with no wifi, so my posts will be sporadic. I’m hoping to borrow the coffee shop’s wifi, as I have in the past, but we’ll see. (Update: I’m using the coffee shop’s wifi, all right.)

Anyway: I’m at Minnedosa for the week. I arrived at the cabin Sunday night, got unpacked, and fell into bed.

Here’s what I’m hoping to accomplish this week:

- **write at least 10,000 words** in “Dried Flowers”, my current novella/novel project. Stretch goal: hit 50,000 words (right now it’s sitting at 35,000 and a bit).
- **get some astrophotography done**. The forecast calls for a couple of clear nights later in the week. I’m hoping to get the Milky Way and—if the sun should oblige—some aurora.
- **read some books.** I brought *The Book of the New Sun*, *Catch-22*, *The Secrets of Judo*, and *Fugitive Telemetry*, and I’ve got a few others saved on my phone if those aren’t enough. (In fairness, when I arrived I had 6 chapters left in *BotNS* and one chapter in *FT*, so those are kind of a gimme.)
- **ride my bike**
- **go kayaking**
- **relax**

Here’s to a good week!
