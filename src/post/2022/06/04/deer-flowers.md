# Deer + Flowers

I went for a bike ride last night. I left the house about 8, got in around 9, and along the way I saw some deer grazing alongside the trail.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">[![Two deer grazing in the shade from the trees](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_8310-2000-1024x683.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_8310-2000.jpg)</figure>â€¦and some flowers, too. Including, finally, some lilacs.
