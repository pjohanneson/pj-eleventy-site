# The Milky Way, just off Hwy 2

I left the house last night around 11:30pm and headed south by southeast, looking for a nice dark spot to get some Milky Way photos. I got set up on a gravel road about 3 miles east of the junction of Highways #10 and #2, and started snapping. Here are some of the shots I liked the most.

Oh well, so it goes. Here’s the 47 minutes compressed into a few seconds’ worth of timelapse video.
