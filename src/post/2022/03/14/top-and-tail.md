# Top and tail

Here’s the first thing in my current <abbr title="Work in Progress">WiP</abbr>, “Dried Flowers”:

> Dedicated to my dad, [JJ](https://patrickjohanneson.com/category/jj/), the way I want to remember him.
> 
> He introduced me to some of my favourite authors, mostly by forgetting to send back the “no I don’t want the Selection of the Month” card to the Science Fiction Book Club((This is how I first encountered, among others, Michael Swanwick and William Gibson.)).

And the final thing in “Dried Flowers” (don’t worry, it’s not a spoiler; just a post-text epigraph((Postgraph?))):

> I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.
> 
> <cite>—Jorge Luis Borges</cite>

…and now, back to writin’.
