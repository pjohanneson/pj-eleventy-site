# 7×7

I had the day off today. I took a broken chair and ottoman to the dump, I did laundry, I talked to my mom and got texts from my sisters, I wrote a few hundred words, I went for a 2-km bike ride (first of the year!), I enjoyed the heck out of a Guinness chocolate cake my wife got for me at Chez Angela, and I taught/studied [a couple foot/leg throws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2vcFAJu_98) at judo((sasae-tsurikomi-ashi (lifting/pulling foot block) and hiza-guruma (knee wheel) )).

I’ve had worse birthdays.
