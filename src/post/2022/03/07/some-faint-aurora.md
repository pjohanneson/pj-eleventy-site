# Some faint aurora

It’s been a while since I went out chasing aurora. Tonight the clouds stayed away, and the temperature, while chilly, didn’t feel like it was going to kill me. I got a couple shots of the aurora, faint and hugging the northern horizon…

(It looks like my camera moved at some point early in the hour. I didn’t jostle it; maybe the wind shifted it slightly.)
