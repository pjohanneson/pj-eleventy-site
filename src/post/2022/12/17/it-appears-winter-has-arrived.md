# It appears winter has arrived

We got a whole bunch of snow over the last few days. Today was the first day in what feels like a long time that the sky was blue and the sun was out.

We noticed some sundogs while headed home from grocery shopping, so I grabbed my camera and headed south of town for some photos. By the time I got there the â€˜dogs were fading, but I got one before they vanished.
