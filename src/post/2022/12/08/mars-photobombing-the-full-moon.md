# Mars photobombing the full moon

The moon tonight is very full and very bright, and there’s a tiny little speck of light juuuuuust about touching it. I checked and it turns out it’s Mars.

(I realize I kind of gave it away in the title. So it goes.)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">[![The full moon. An inset shows the very small, slightly reddish dot that is Mars.](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_8146-moon-and-mars-1200-1024x768.jpg)](https://patrickjohanneson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_8146-moon-and-mars-1200.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">That tiny reddish dot in the 4×original size inset? That’s a planet.</figcaption></figure>\[Edit\] I just realized it’s also the 50th anniversary today of the launch of [Apollo 17](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo-17), the last crewed mission to the moon. Here’s to the continued success of [the Artemis project](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/) and the return of humans to the lunar surface.
