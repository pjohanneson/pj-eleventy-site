# Bike Ride &#8211; July 17, 2022

I went for a 25km bike ride this morning, before it got too hot outside. I ended up going a bit east of <abbr title="Assiniboine Community College">ACC</abbr>‘s North Hill campus, which once upon a time was the Brandon Mental Health Centre, or BMHC.

I found the BMHC cemetery, and took a few photos.

All four sides had a plaque, and each plaque was about that full.

I even found a Johanneson on the cairn (though I doubt we’re related).
