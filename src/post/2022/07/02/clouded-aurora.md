# Clouded Aurora

After I watched the new [*Top Gun* talkie](https://patrickjohanneson.com/2022/07/02/top-gun-redux/), I checked the data in my aurora app while I was still in the parking lot. It looked good((The Bz reading was -11, where the further into the negative, the better; I usually see a decent show if it’s at -4 or so.)), so I hurried home, grabbed my gear, and went out of town.

Unfortunately it was cloudy to the north. I set up anyway, hoping the clouds would move off, and started snapping photos.

Long story short: the clouds didn’t move off. I gave it about 45 minutes, and then packed up and went home.

Here’s a timelapse of about 20 minutes’ worth of my attempts. Each frame is a 10-second exposure.

And here’s a handful of my favourites from the photos I got. (I think I caught a meteor in the first one, on the far left.)
